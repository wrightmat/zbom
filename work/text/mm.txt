Hey! If I call you, press (^) right
away!

I can tell you're not very used to
your Deku Scrub body yet.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
All right, listen up! If you press
and hold (A) as a Deku Scrub
while standing on a Deku Flower,
you can dive into it.
If you wait a bit before releasing
(A), you'll launch out of the
flower. Press (A) while flying to
descend.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Did you get that?
 
No
Yes
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Are you sure?

One more thing: Press (A) when
you're on the ground to perform a
spin attack!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ugh! That stench!
This place stinks just like that
poison swamp!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What do you think that is?
The ashes in the center of it still
look fresh...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This looks pretty light.
Well, don't just stand there--
Press (A) to grab it and use (+)
to move it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This torch is still warm...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Be careful...
I sense a lot of evil here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Look!
From up here, we have a better
view of that shrine below. 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, I'm trying to tell you
something...
This torch is still warm, too.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What? It's an icicle!
It's just like the one we saw
outside!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmm...This is kind of big...
It's gonna take more than average
strength to move this thing!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What, you think you can push
down something this big just by
standing on top of it?

You're going to have to find some
way to pound it down.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
W-What just happened?!
Everything has...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...started over...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wha...What are you, anyway? 
That song you played...
That instrument...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...That instrument!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wait! That's it!
Your instrument!!!

The mask salesman said that if
you got back the precious thing
that was stolen from you, he
could return you to normal!
Did you completely forget or
what?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He gives me the creeps! That
mask salesman was the...
Sorry...just thinking aloud.

But three days? Even if we never
sleep, that still leaves us with a
measly 72 hours!
Talk about demanding!
Well, don't just stand there!
We're going to see the
Great Fairy!

Look, you wanna find the Skull
Kid, don't you?

The Great Fairy will know what
he's up to. She watches over
everything.

And just between you and me,
the Skull Kid is no match for the
Great Fairy.

Go to the shrine near the
North Gate. You'll find the
Great Fairy in there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That mask...
The Skull Kid uses the power of
that mask to do those terrible
things.
Well...whatever it takes, we've
gotta do something about it.

...The swamp, mountains, ocean and
canyon that Tael was trying to
tell us about...

I bet he was referring to the
four areas just outside town.
There's one in each compass
direction.
But what do you suppose he
meant by "the four who are
there?"

I have no idea. He always
skips important stuff. I guess we
should just go and find out...

If we go through that gate
straight ahead, we'll be heading in
the direction of the swamp.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! I remember this!

Tael and I drew this with the
Skull Kid when we first met him...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He told us that he had been
fighting with his friends and that
they had left him all alone...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm sure it was because he was
always playing tricks, so nobody
wanted to play with him.

But to do what he did just
because of that...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And once he got his power...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh no! The Great Fairy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, aren't you going to the
Great Fairy's shrine near the
North Gate?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That Skull Kid has gone too far!
We can't just let this happen!

Quick! We have to find the
Stray Fairy in town and return
the Great Fairy to normal!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What are you doing?
Aren't you gonna take this fairy
to the shrine near the North
Gate?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Great Fairy said the
astronomer knows the Skull Kid...

Hurry! We need to find a way to
get out of town and to the
observatory!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He said the secret route is in
East Clock Town...
So why aren't you going there?

Don't tell me you forgot
the code!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I wonder how the astronomer
knows the Skull Kid?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What's the Skull Kid doing all the
way up there?!

Well, whatever...
But aren't you at least interested
in that thing that fell from the
moon?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Did you hear those fireworks?
I think the clock tower door has
just opened!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, you! C'mon! Press (Z) and
talk to me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There you go! See? You can do it
if you try!

When I fly over to people or
objects, use (Z) to look at them
so you can talk to them.

Use Z Targeting to talk to people
even if they're far away.
 

Or, if there's no one to target,
you can use (Z) to look straight
ahead. 

But enough about that for now...
Come over to this tree and check
it out!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's strange, but the way you look
right now sort of looks like this
tree...

It looks all dark and gloomy...
almost like it could start crying
any second now...
How sad... 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The four people Tael talked
about...

Do you think he was talking about
the spirit that was sealed inside
that mask?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Oh! Hey, you were pretty good
out there!
Have you done this before or
what?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now, just keep up that pace and
save the other three!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey!

Um...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
All that stuff I did to you...
...your horse...
I...I apologize.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Sorry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There! I apologized!
So don't hold it against me,
got it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now then, we've helped the
princess just like the monkey
asked...

So now our next stop is in the
mountains! Let's hurry and do
something about that Skull Kid!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The quickest way to the mountains
is through the North Gate!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The quickest way to the ocean is

What's with that Deku Scrub?
It's just sleeping here like a lazy
fool! What a pain!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Isn't this the Deku Scrub mark?
I wonder if they worshiped here...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whoa! He's frozen solid!
Wow! He's one ancient Goron,
isn't he?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What's that?
There's something in the middle of
that blizzard... 
Can't you see it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey! Isn't this snowball bigger
than the others?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Up here! Take a look at this!
I bet if you had a weapon that
was strong enough, one shot from
it could pierce right through this!
Well, it might take two shots...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Aha! So the Gorons fall asleep if
they hear the Goron's Lullaby!
That's convenient...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, how do you get up there?
I don't see anything to climb on!

What can we use?  There's really
nothing here besides that jiggly
blob.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are these all piled on top of
one another?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

We've gathered them all together,
so we just have to go to the

stupid brats' little games?
C'mon! Hurry up and find them

All right, so we know where the

Whoa!!! Look at the time!
You don't even have three days

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whoa!!! Look at the time! You

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Whoa!!! Look at the time! You

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Whoa!!! Look at the time! You

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey...hang on! 
Doesn't this look a little strange?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Isn't this...
a Zora egg?
I wonder how we can carry it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's a huge fish!
I bet that thing could eat a small
fish in a single bite...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, what do you think that is?
Out there in the bay, beneath
where the gulls are flying...
Can't you see it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I can't see it, but I sense there's
a thirst for blood looming all
around us...

Don't you have a mask that can
summon the unseen?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This mummy looks different...
Sorta like it's here waiting for its
human heart to be healed.

Well, do something!
Haven't you figured it out yet?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Here! See!
You always miss things like this.
Take a look...
The rocks are cracked here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whoa! That's a huge waterwheel!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmm...I get it...
That huge waterwheel is powering
this thing...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why is this the only pillar that's
a different color?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Is this a mirror?
This thing looks different from
your everyday mirror.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's no good!
It's not stopping!
It's hopeless!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wait! You still haven't solved the
problem with the swamp at
Woodfall!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wait! You still haven't solved the
problem with the mountains at
Snowhead!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Wait! You still haven't solved the
problem with the ocean at
Great Bay!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Let them be! Don't you get it?

You're so insensitive!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't stop now!
Look! You can get up there now!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
L-Look!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Isn't that your horse?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I smell salt in the air, so the
ocean must be near.
But with this tall fence in the
way, we can't go any farther.
If only you had a horse to ride,
we could--Oops!
Sorry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmph! This fence is the worst!
If we want to get up there, we'll
have to jump this fence!

But you can't do it like this.
I guess we'll have to give up...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is no good!
If we could just blast these
snowballs out of the way, we
could get through!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We have a good view of their
leader's room from here.

And I bet if you needed to, you
could shoot an arrow through
these bars!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I thought this room was pretty
dark...but now I get it.

!?!
Don't tell me you still haven't
figured it out?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Look!
Can't you use the Hookshot on
that chest?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you could somehow step on
top of that Octorok, I bet you'd
be able to climb onto that central
pillar.
But the Octorok is so squishy and
it keeps squirming around...
There's gotta be something you
can do!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

At slippery places like this, you
can curl up as a Goron and roll

Won't you deposit some Rupees?

Nowadays, even if people have
money, they don't deposit any.
Nothing!  Nothing!!!

a special gift based on how much
you deposit.

200 Rupees, you'll get an item

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The timing for your trip to
Snowhead is great. You'd better
leave town as quickly as you can!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Returning to Snowhead, are you?
Then you should leave as quickly
as you can!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you're going to the mountains
of Snowhead, your timing is great.
You should leave town as quickly
as you can.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wait just a moment!

If you came to town with your
parents, find them quickly and
leave this place!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Most everyone who believes the
moon will fall has left town.

The only ones left are those who
don't believe the rumors or aren't
aware of them.

I want to tell everyone to
evacuate, but I cannot leave my
post.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
See! Look at the moon...
Leave town before the
evacuation notice is made!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wait! I have a question!

Do you know whether or not the
carnival has been canceled?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm sorry to stop you, but since
I must stay at my post, I'm unable
to get any news...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I am not going to tell you
anything bad...But even Great Bay
is better than here. Just leave
town while you can.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you're going to Great Bay, your
timing is great. You should leave
here as quickly as you can!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Returning to Great Bay, are you? 

If so, your timing is great. You
should leave here as quickly as
you can.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wait just a moment!

Are you alone?
Aren't your parents still
somewhere in town?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, whatever you do, you had
better get as far away from here
as you can.

And there are still people lingering
in the stores...
If only an evacuation notice had
been posted, I would be able to
force them all to leave...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The moon has gotten so large!
Quick! Take refuge as far away
from town as you can!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wait! I want to ask you
something!

Do you know whether or not the
carnival has been canceled?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I am sorry to bother you when
you are in such a rush.
I guess finding out the answer
would do little good, anyway.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Stone Tower is in this direction.
I shall speak no ill. Just get out
of town while you are still able.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You can get to Stone Tower from
here. You should leave town while
you can.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wait just a moment!

If you believe that the moon truly
is falling, you'd best leave town
immediately!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Those who remain in town either
don't believe the rumors or have
given up all hope.

It pains my heart to see children
still playing in the streets
because they have no idea what's
going on...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You can get to Stone Tower from
here.

If there's even a small part of
you that believes the moon could
be falling, you should leave town
immediately.

I have been enamored with the

Now, I spend my days gazing at
it from here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The moon has long been
considered a mystical body, which
people have worshiped and feared.

That alone shows how the moon
has a cosmic influence that
affects our daily lives.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But lately, there is something
quite strange with the moon.
Strange, indeed...

It seems as though the moon is
being pulled down by something
and is slowly drawing closer.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So, will you gaze into the
telescope?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...I see.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why did you stop? 
Won't you look again?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That is one of the lunar rocks
that has been blazing from the
surface of the moon lately.

They fall from what looks to be
the moon's eye, so I call them
Moon's Tears.

They are rare stones, valued by
many in town.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you have another question
for me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

To me, it seems as if the moon is
being pulled in by something and
is gradually drawing closer.

Don't you sense the change in the
moon?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well...could you see it?
It already may be impossible to
stop its descent...

All I can do is accept what the
cosmos has designed to be the
destiny for me and this planet.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How was it?
It's looking worse, isn't it?
It would be nice if things just
stayed as they are now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How was it?

My calculations suggest the moon
will fall in another ç.
I'm just hoping I was thinking too
hard.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, could you see it?
This is no joke...the moon is
actually falling!

At this pace, it should hit the
earth in just ç...
What can we possibly do?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, well...A strange-looking child
has joined me today...

Are you a new friend of the
Bombers gang?

...Hmmm.
Your manners seem much better
than those of your mischievous
friend from the other day.
Hrnf, hrnf, hrnf!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That ill-mannered troublemaker
from the other day said he'd
break my instruments...

He said he'd steal my Moon's Tear...
There was no stopping him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Even now! Just watch him! He's
probably causing trouble around
the clock tower.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Will you gaze into the

Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

are still young!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, did you find that
troublemaker?

You can zoom in with (A).
Try looking near the clock tower.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, did you find that
troublemaker? And that loud
noise...What was that?

Perhaps another Moon's Tear has
fallen nearby...Go through that
door and take a look outside.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But I wonder how that
troublemaker got on top of the
clock tower?

The only way up there is through
the clock door, and that opens
only on the eve of the carnival.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What could that troublemaker be
doing atop the clock tower?

I just hope he's not plotting
another one of his no-good
tricks...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I've already sold out of my wares,

begun.

I'm thinking of closing up shop so
I can buy a gift for my wife and
return to her in my village!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I've heard that a stone called the
Moon's Tear shines brighter than
any other in the land!

If you've got one, I'd really like
to get it from you. My wife
would love it!

If you give it to me, I'll give you
my spot here...
Deku Flower included!

If you have a Moon's Tear, I must
get it from you! My wife would

my spot here... 
Deku Flower included!
That's a good deal!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you have one?

You're a Deku Scrub, so you know
just how convenient a Deku
Flower can be.

If you don't hurry, I'll give it to
another Deku Scrub. The early
Scrub gets the nut!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah! That stone! You must hand it
over to me!

In exchange, I'll give you my spot
here...Deku Flower included!
Yes?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You really helped me out! Now I
have the perfect souvenir for my
wife!

She hasn't set eyes on a jewel or
strange, sparkling stone like this
in a very long time.

The Title Deed for this spot
should be in high demand among
Deku Scrubs, but you already
know that.
If you don't need it anymore, you
can always sell it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sir! Sir!

I keep hearing about a stone
called a Moon's Tear, and it's
supposed to be the shiniest stone
in the world!
Do you have one?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you have one, I'll trade you this
spot and I'll throw in the Deku
Flower, too!

This is a very popular spot among
Deku Scrubs. Haven't you heard
about this spot? I'm telling you,
it's a real bargain!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sir, if you have a Moon's Tear,
I must get it from you...And I'm

Ah!

Sir, you've really helped me out!
Now I have the perfect souvenir
for my wife!

She hasn't seen a jewel or
strange, shining stone like this in
quite a long time...Hee-hee!

The Title Deed for this spot will
be in big demand by Deku Scrubs
outside of town.

You should be able to sell it to a
Deku Scrub for a good price!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey, Deku kid! You waitin' for us
to finish the bridge from the
festival tower to the clock tower
entrance up there?
Sorry! My apprentices panicked
and ran away! This is all we get
for a festival tower. It's not quite
tall enough, is it? Sheesh!
Even if we went to the top of the
festival tower, we wouldn't be able
to get up to the clock tower
entrance!
I apologize for all this.
I wish I could scare that moon
away!

Actually, we should've had

Umm, Mommy...
Don't go picking up bomb bags in

It's like asking to be mugged.

And I've actually heard that a

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

But it's been our lifelong dream to

you to carry.
Sorry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Look, I think you should get outta

Besides, my bombs are too big and
heavy for you to carry...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh! Of all places!

You're a Goron, so you should be

Oh, but you don't have enough
Rupees...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Huh? Do you mean you haven't

Kegs, yet?

Too bad! And I was hoping I could

Powder Kegs are extremely
powerful and dangerous, so those
who haven't been approved by the
instructor can't carry them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK, listen here. My instructor

Come back here after he teaches

You can carry Powder Kegs,

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

We Bombers have a hideout that

You need a code to get in. Maybe
I'll tell you what it is!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But don't think you're getting it
that easily! I can't just tell you
what the code is...
You'll have to pass my test first.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you ready?

If you can find all five of us by

Are you ready?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I thought you were tougher than
that...But you're nothing special!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You did it!
So what's your name, guy?

Link, huh?

All right! That Skull Kid broke our
rules and he's been doing all
kinds of bad things lately.

Starting today, he's out! I'm
making Link a Bomber! You
guys don't mind, right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

    Only 20 people will fit in
    your book.
2. Promise to help them.
    Mark promises with Promise
    Stickers. Never be late with
    fulfilling your promises.
3. Whenever you solve someone's
    problem, it makes you happy,
    so a Happy Sticker will be
    added to your book.
4. No removing stickers!
    Use Promise Stickers to keep
    track of people until everyone
    is happy.
Don't forget the rules!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

All right, then. I'll teach you our

If you wanna be a member, go see
Jim in North Clock Town!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you want to pass through here,
you have to say the secret code!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Umm...This is a secret place just
for little kids. Adults aren't
allowed here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

What's the code?
Ñ
Pick numbers with (+) and press
(A) to decide.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Umm...That's right. If you know the
code, then you're a member, right?
OK, here you go!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wrong!

Jim said I can't let anyone who
doesn't know the code in.

____________________________________
Aw! No way! You finally got me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Leave me alone!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey, guy! You haven't passed my

secret code?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, guy!
How do you know our secret
code?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Listen, guy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're pretty good!

You managed to figure out a code

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What's your name, guy?

Link, huh?
All right...That Skull Kid broke our

I'm making Link a new

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We Bombers have our hideout at

You have to take a secret route
to get to it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! Don't be telling Jim in North
Clock Town that I told you that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The secret route to the

about that?

Only Jim and us are supposed to
know about that secret route...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't tell anyone that you heard
about the secret route from me,
got it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey, buddy! Have you found any
troubled people? If you do, add

Did you memorize the code?
If only you were human...then I
could make you a Bombers

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're pretty good for
a Deku Scrub!

If only you were human...

Then I could give you an original

What do you guys think?

____________________________________
No way! No Scrubs!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I guess not...Once, we let some
kid who wasn't human join our

it! Sorry!
But I'll teach you the code, just
like I promised. I can tell you only
once, though, so pay close
attention!
Are you ready?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The code is ß!
The entrance to our hideout is in
East Clock Town!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Don't you want to join the

Link, I am truly thankful for
what you have done for the

As a sign of our gratitude, we

that we think may assist you.
I will lead you to it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Well done, Link!

Now, here is the item I promised.
Please accept it.

Please follow me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Actually, when I see
you, I am reminded of
my son who left home
long ago...
Somehow, I feel as if I am once
again racing with my son...

I am afraid I may have tried too
hard to outrun you. As old as I
am, I am still a fast competitor.
Just like when I raced my son...
Please forgive my rudeness.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Ah?!?
That mask...

It looks just like one my son used
to wear...

My son often used that mask to
find mushrooms in the forest. Oh,
how I long for those days.

I wonder where he has gone...what
he is doing...
If only he would write me a
letter...
Pardon me. Once again, thoughts
of my son have me feeling
sentimental. Now, where were we?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

But in his current state, the king
can't even send troops out to look

What are we to do?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's terribly sad...
But nothing can calm the king
now....

Our swamps have become
poisoned...This may be the end of
the Deku Kingdom!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

More than anything, I'm just glad
the princess has returned safely.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

That means we can now go to

before.

I saw it! That monkey and the
princess entering the temple at
night!
 
...But only the monkey came
back out!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Rumor has it that the
monkey ate the princess...

How frightful!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Only royal family members can

obvious that the monkey was

...Welcome.

My potions work very well,
they do.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Are you, by chance,
a boat cruise customer?

How unfortunate. Koume has gone
into the woods out back, looking
for mushrooms...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmm...Now that I think about it,
she's a bit late coming back!

Say, could you go find her for
me?

Hmm, yes. It's easy getting lost in
those woods. Ask the monkeys
that live there.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What's that?!?
The Skull Kid got to Koume?!?

That's ridiculous...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If it's just the Skull Kid, then
what harm could he possibly do?

Oh!!
Well, if that's true, then take this
potion to her...
This isn't good...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Quick! Take that potion to her!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! Did you give that potion to
Koume?
Don't tell me...
You didn't drink it all yourself, did
you?
.........
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Well, I'll be!
You're a hopeless child.
Next time, be sure you actually
give it to her!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Koume told me all about it!

Hmm...So, did you take the boat
cruise yet?

Oh, you did a great job finding

I just haven't been able to get my

cage. Take a good look at his
face!

The monkey shall suffer and
suffer 'til he can suffer no more!

king whose darling princess was
taken away from him!!!

Oh, strange traveler, there is
little I can do. Please rest a bit

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Everyone, did you hear that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This melody, which only the Deku
Royal Family knows...

It proves the foolish monkey
deceived the princess so he could
enter the temple!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Everyone!
Let the monkey's punishment
commence!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
They keep saying that I kidnapped
her. No matter how many times
they say it, it's not going to bring
the princess back! 
If they're not careful, the princess
will fall victim to a monster!

If they see you, they'll capture
you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What? My brothers asked for
your help? Ugh...I'm terribly
sorry...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Just try to cut my rope. We'll
talk after that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What are you doing? Quick--cut
this rope!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh? That guy...
Where did he go???
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmm...No good, after all!

Wait...You don't happen to have
something that can make a lot of 
noise...like a loud instrument with
sound that carries a long way?
If you have one, show it to me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you have one, show me! We
have to use it...

Please! An instrument that can 
blare out a lot of sound that'll
carry a long way!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That tiny thing will never do. Its
sound won't carry far enough...

Don't you have something else?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmm...That definitely makes noise...
but that's not it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's not it.
One with blaring sound that
carries even farther!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh? That guy...
Where did he go?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! You have them! You do!
Just like the princess...
Deku Pipes!
Those will work great!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
By the way...who are you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
By the way...who are you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
By the way...who are you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Whoa!
That's not important now...
Just listen to me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I was trying to find out about the
poison in the swamp, so I went to
Woodfall Temple above the
waterfall.
But the temple had become a
monster's lair, and the princess
was captured by the monster...

Since the Deku king thinks I
kidnapped the princess, he won't
listen to a word I say.

Now the princess is in trouble, so
I must somehow hurry to the
temple and save her!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you understand my plight?
 
No
Yes
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Then I will tell you and tell you
until it is clear to you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So then, that means...

You will go in my place and save
the princess!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK, now I'll teach you the melody
that opens the temple.

The princess taught it to me!

he gave me this mask.

He said the instructions were

It's yours!

Do you need any Magic Beans?
They sprout leaves as soon as

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mmm, I'll give you one free sample,
so try planting it in some soft

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mmm...So you liked my Magic
Beans and came back to buy
more?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's 10 Rupees for one pod.
 
I'll buy it
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mmm...Well, if your mood changes,
come back and buy some.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mmm...
You don't have enough Rupees.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You can plant 'em whenever you
want, but if you don't water 'em,
their leaves won't grow.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You can't carry anymore.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Link?
Pleased to meet you. I am the
Deku princess.

Were you, by chance, asked by
that monkey to come save me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Aha! Just as I suspected!
You see, your body smells a little
bit like monkey.
 
So...the monkey made it back fine
after all. That's good.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I was worried that when I didn't
come home, my father would think
that monkey had kidnapped me!

I was worried that my father
would even go so far as to punish
the poor monkey!

Hoo-hoo-hoo.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
......
Don't tell me...
Are you serious?!?S
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Is father actually doing that?!?
Yet another hasty decision,
father!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
W-Well, we haven't any time to
lose...

Quickly, Mr. Link, could you
please find something to carry me
in so you can take me to the
Deku Palace?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's Mr. Link, correct?
You, sir, have strange powers,
indeed...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I don't mind tight places, so surely
you have something you can put
me in to carry me...

If you have anything at all, then,
by all means, take it out and use
it right here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hwh-Hwhy are you hwaiting?
Mr. Link!

Huh-Hurry! Ho-Hopen this bottle
and release me right hwh-hwhere
my father is standing.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
H-Hufff-huhhh!
Foolish father!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
WHAT are you doing?!?
Let that monkey go this instant!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, Mr. Monkey, I am truly sorry.
Father does such rash things
when he's worried about me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why yes, thanks to
Mr. Link here.
I am very, truly grateful.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
As a symbol of our gratitude, our
butler has prepared a little
something for you.
Please accept it.
You'll find it in the shrine that
will be to your right when you
leave the palace.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It seems our butler has taken
somewhat of a liking to you,
Mr. Link.

I believe you'll find him waiting in
the shrine that will be to your
right when you leave the palace.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I shall never forget what you have
done for us.

But please forgive me if I refuse
to ride in that tiny, little bottle
ever again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ungh! Mr. Link!
There's nuh-no time to lose!
Huh-Hurry! Take me to the palace!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Blimey!
Where is he? That spoiled child is

A child his age has no business

____________________________________
Oh! Ahem...Welcome!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh...The pictograph contest we're
holding is only for humans.
Sorry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well then, why don't you show me
the pictograph you've taken?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you happened to come here to
show me a pictograph...I hate to
say it, but the contest has ended.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah! But I do hear the boat cruise
is starting up a new attraction,
so go to that window over there
and ask them about it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! You really captured the white
with this shot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And these guys are quick, too!
This is a difficult shot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now then, please choose your
prize:
20 Rupees
Another boat cruise
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Bring us another nice pictograph
if you can, all right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You must really like that boat
cruise. All right...Off you go...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I hope you enjoyed it. Bring us
another nice pictograph again, 
all right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh!
This is a Big Octo...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm pretty sure others have taken
pictographs of those before...

But if you get too close to one of
those things, it'll suck you in, so
it's pretty hard to take a decent
shot.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmm...That's kind of a standard
shot, don't ya think?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, it is a good shot...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
All right...Choose your prize...
 
5 Rupees
Another boat cruise
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're a challenger, aren't you?
All right...Off you go...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, how was it? Did you take a
nice pictograph?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't give up. Come back again
with another picture.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey...You didn't take this
pictograph in the swamp, now did
you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You can't enter the contest with
pictographs that weren't taken in
the swamp. It is a nice shot,
though...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh? Is this your first time
entering the pictograph contest?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, the Swamp Tourist Center is
currently holding a pictograph
contest.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's open to all ages,
from children to adults.

For nice pictographs taken in the
swamp, a free boat cruise will be
awarded as a special prize.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So, would you like to enter our
contest?

Oh, but to enter, you first must
take the boat cruise.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Boat cruise reservations are
handled at that window over
there.

If you're interested, go for a ride.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh? Haven't you gotten a
pictograph box yet?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you take the boat cruise, they'll
give you one for sure. Go ask at
that window.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We're running the pictograph
contest for a brief time only.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Welcome to the boat cruise.
Please set your pictograph box to
(C), then press (C) to look
through it.(Please enjoy the swamp scenery
to your heart's content.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Well, here's a problem. You haven't

I can't accept this.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wha!!! That's my son!
Eesh...Is he still doing that sort of
thing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Urgh...How humiliating! This guy...
He's my son...

As old as he is, he's still doing
some pretty silly stuff.

I guess I spoiled him too much
when I was raising him...But he
really is a kindhearted boy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, thank you for going to all
that trouble. This is just a small
token of my gratitude!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But could you tell my son
something for me?

...Could you, uh, please ask him
not to go outside in that outfit
anymore?

Hoo-Hoot!
We meet again, fairy child! Have
my stone statues been of help?

Well, it seems you may have the
strength to change the fate of
this land as I had expected.

But the road ahead is even more
challenging. Many trials await you.
Please watch over these Gorons
around you.
Their land is doomed to be
smothered in snow and ice
forever. It will become a land
where no living thing can survive.
Without courage and
determination, you surely will
collapse from the extreme 
conditions...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But if that courage and
determination burns bright within
you, then that's another story...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So, will you proceed?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hoo-Hoot!
You are a child of many
strengths!

Well, perhaps you do have enough
strength to change the fate of
this mountain after all.

I shall take to the air now, flying
toward that shrine across the
way, so follow behind me.

Do not be daunted by
appearances. Instead, let your
feelings guide you, and the true
path shall open before you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you ready?
Follow behind me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I shall pass no judgment.
If that is your decision, then
return to town.

After retreat, courage returns.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What is it that you are doing?
Beyond here you will fall into 
oblivion unless you have great
courage and determination.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It seems things are not going well
for you...Hoo-Hoot! Fear not, it
never goes well at first for
anyone.
But by no means should you
grow impatient. Impatience brings
uneasiness and distracts the
heart.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, will you try again?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I see...
Then hurry back to town.
After retreat, courage will rise
again.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Very good. I shall fly toward that
shrine. Follow behind me.

Do not be daunted by
appearances. Instead, let your
feelings guide you, and the true
path shall open before you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hoo-Hoot!
I have certainly been assured of
your courage and determination.

From here on, you must not be
fooled by appearances. You must
rely on your feelings...

Now, enter the shrine. Something
that will aid you in your quest
lies within. Use that item when
returning from here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ho-ho-ho-ho-hoot!
This is a rare sight. You are a
fairy child, correct?

What business might you have in
this poisoned swamp?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you dare not venture further,
I shall pass no judgment.
It is better that you hurry back
to town.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This swamp you are in has lost
its guardian deity. But it was
destined to fade anyway.

Hoo-hoot...And that destiny is not
solely limited to this swamp...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you have the courage and
determination to proceed in the
face of destiny, then I shall teach
you something useful.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Before coming here, had you not
seen any of the stone statues
that bear close resemblance
to me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I have placed those throughout
the land to aid the one with the
power to change the destiny of
this land...
Wherever he may appear.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you have left proof of our
encounter on any of those stone
statues...

Then the song carved at my feet
will certainly be of some
assistance...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Remember it well and play it
wherever the need arises.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

From the first time you play this

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Unfortunately, we're not doing any

this abnormal cold snap we've

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

See?
Our hearth has been frozen over!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The way things are going now,
I won't be able to do any business
until spring...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

If I could just do something about
that frozen hearth...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ugo-oh! Ugo, ugo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Eh? What's that?

You say if we had hot water, we

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You've gotta understand, I have to

Come back in the spring after the
ice melts.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh, a customer?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sorry, but we do only swords and

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sorry, but we do only swords and
cutlery.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sorry...It would take until
tomorrow morning to sharpen your
sword, and we're not taking any
more orders today.
...Why, you ask? Because
tomorrow is the town's carnival,
and you can't work during the
carnival, can you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Gabora, fetch our customer some
coffee, quick-like.

Now then, let me take a look at
your sword.

Hmmm...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
All right...To reforge your sword,
it will cost you 100 Rupees. It'll
be ready at sunrise.

You'll have to let us hold onto
your sword until then.

Keep in mind that after you use
your reforged sword 100 times, it
will lose its edge and it'll be back
to its original sharpness...
So, would you like your sword
reforged for 100 Rupees?
I'll do it
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, really? Then it can't really be
helped. Drop by again sometime.

Gabora, forget about the coffee!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is a secret, but I'll let you in
on it...If you bring me some gold
dust, I can forge you the
strongest of swords...
It'll never lose its edge. It's the
strongest. The strongest...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Reforge your sword?
 
Yes
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh? You don't have 100 Rupees?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Gabora...
Say goodbye to the customer.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And we just got the ice melted
off the hearth and everything...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thanks for dropping in. Now then,
I'm straight off to work!

Come back tomorrow morning.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ugoh ugo ugo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Your sword will be ready tomorrow
morning. We'll take good care of
it, so don't worry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, now that's a mean joke. Your
sword has already been reforged
into a Razor Sword!

Unless...
Do you want me to make your
sword stronger?

To do that, I'll need gold dust.
Do you have any?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why, if it isn't gold dust! And it's
even top quality!!!

Why, even if I use it to reforge
your sword, there'll still be some
left...

All right! Just for you, I'll do this
for free. But don't tell anyone!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh? That's not gold dust.

...You can't get your hands on it
that easily, you know!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ugoh-ugo-ugo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What? What?!? You say that
gold dust is the prize for winning
the Patriarch's Race that's held by
the Gorons every spring?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What if you tried entering that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
To make your sword any stronger,
I'll need gold dust, which just so
happens to be first prize at the
Goron racetrack.
If I can just get some gold dust...
and this is just between us...I can
make you the strongest of
swords. The strongest...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey! Hey! Take it easy!
Your sword is already as strong
as I can make it!

It's impossible to make it any
stronger. It doesn't matter how
much gold dust you pack in
there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But...
If you have gold dust, I'll buy it
off you for 40 Rupees.
How about it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh? Look, I'm working on
strengthening your sword. I'm
busy, so don't bother me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Grrr...You're persistent...
I can't focus on my work! Just
wait until morning!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I kept you waiting...
But it's done! See?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now keep in mind that after
you've used this 100 times, the
blade will lose its edge and will
return to its original sharpness.
Now here's a secret...If you bring
me gold dust before this sword
loses its edge, I'll be able to make
it the strongest sword around.
You got that? Gold dust!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ugoh!
Ugoh ugo ugo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There it is. We can't make a
sword stronger than that.

No matter how many times you
use it, it will never lose its edge.
Try it.

Oh, I used up most of the gold
dust. Just a tiny bit was left, so
I got rid of it for you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ugo-oh!
Ugoh ugo ugo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thanks for dropping in!
You got a great deal.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you get any more quality gold
dust, you'll sell it to me, right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What? You're telling me that's
not enough? No way. That's the
going price. The going price!

No one else will buy it for this
much...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So, come on...Will you sell it for
40 Rupees?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm the Goron who sells the
Powder Keg, the most famous
product of the Gorons.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Want a Powder Keg?
Powder kegs explode with powerful
blasts and are very dangerous...

Until I have tested you to see if
you can use them properly, I can't
let you use any on your own.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Will you give it a try?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you can destroy the boulder
that blocks the entrance to the
Goron Racetrack near here...

using the Powder Keg I'm about
to give you, then I'll approve you
to carry them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
When the Powder Keg begins 
ticking faster, it means that it's
about to explode.

Try to blow up the boulder
blocking the Goron Racetrack
entrance without the Powder Keg
exploding on the way.
There's a sign near the racetrack,
so keep an eye out for it. When
you've finished, come see me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Come back if you change your
mind.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It looks like you managed to
succeed! Knowing your skills, I
feel fine letting you handle Powder
Kegs on your own.
It was bad of me to put you
through such a dangerous test. I
want you to take this as my
apology.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Powder Kegs are very
volatile, so you can carry only one
at a time.

If you shoot them with an arrow,
they'll explode as soon as they're
hit, so be careful.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You failed?
In that case, I can't approve you
to use Powder Kegs.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Will you take the challenge again?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you change your mind, see me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You can carry only one Powder
Keg at a time. Once you've used
it, come back.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Will you a buy a Powder Keg for
100 Rupees?
I'll buy it
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you change your mind, see me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I can't remember a thing since I

If you truly can see me, then

It seems that it turned out to be

I am Darmani the Third.
The blood of proud Goron heroes
runs in me.

This feels strange for me to say,
but when I was alive, I was a

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yes...When I was alive...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

But alas...
I am now dead.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I was fine until I marched off to
Snowhead by myself, hoping that
I could drive off a demon.

It had been wreaking havoc on
Goron Village...Then the blizzard at
Snowhead blew me into the valley.
...And now...Here I am...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...How infuriating!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

As I am, I can only watch as

cannot rest.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

So, you can use magic? The
soaring one also told me that you

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I beg you! Bring me back to life
with your magic!

If it is beyond your power, then
I beg of you to do this for me
instead...

Heal my sorrows. Any way that
you can do it will suffice...
Please...heal my sorrows.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Medicine works only on the
living. It will do me no good.

Please...Just heal my sorrows. You
need not bring me back to

I know you can do this for me as
you are right now. I beg of you.
Heal my sorrows.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

____________________________________
Oh, chosen Goron hero!
Your power to lift objects without
effort is mightier than the
strength of any other.
And your heart is strong, too, as
it is filled with compassion that is
kinder than any other.

Goron heroes press (A) and (+)
so that they may curl up and roll
wherever it is that they may need
to go.
If Gorons who possess magic
power roll swiftly enough, spikes
will emerge from their bodies so
that they may mow down enemies.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Water is disastrous for Goron
heroes, for they sink like stones
and are rendered motionless in
the deep. Beware.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The powerful punch that Goron
heroes unleash by pressing (B)
is feared by all.

By repeatedly pressing (B), Goron
heroes will deal out a barrage of
punches.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
After using (A) to curl up, a 
Goron can jump with (B) and
land with quaking impact that is
so mighty it can flatten enemies.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I wish someone would do
something...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Urrrgh...
I can feel it pounding in the back
of my head.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Darmani?
You're alive?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The Goron Elder said you had
died...
Was that a lie?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

So...does that incessant crying
sound familiar to you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The Goron Elder's son won't stop
crying.

from crying again...

In weather this cold, even I want
to start crying...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The crying stopped, but it's
still c-c-cold...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's Darmani!
You were always good at calming
the Elder's son.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now...
The next thing we have to do is 
something about the torchlights
in this room.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It'd be nice if we could do
something about the torchlights,
but...

In this cold, we can't even get a
fire going. What should we do?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh!
The chandelier!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So this is how it works.
I had no idea.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I think it somehow got a little
warmer...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ohhh...
I can feel it pounding in the back
of my head! 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! Darmani!
You're alive...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is wonderful!
But there's no time for catching
up...If something isn't done right
now about that crying...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Look at this!
The torch that was just lit has
gone out.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ugh! Again with that terrible
crying...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If this crying doesn't stop, the
torches will never get lit.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hooo...
You saved me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
To think that his crying can put
out a torch...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's the Goron Elder's son for
you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm just glad the torchlights are
back to normal. Now it should be
a little warmer in here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hooo...That helped.
The torchlights are back to
normal.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You look like you're doing fine
despite all this noise.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I can feel it in my gut. It's
echoing in my empty stomach!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wha!!! You're Darmani!
You're supposed to be dead!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Is that crying getting to me that
it has my eyes playing tricks on
me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If this keeps up, I'll really go
crazy...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thank heavens!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Was the Elder's son crying
because he was hungry?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There's nothing we can do.
It's gotten so cold in the
mountains...

we just can't seem to get our
hands on any of our food...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
At this rate, everyone will go
hungry and die.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But I have an emergency supply of
food hidden away, so I'll be fine...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's a good thing I hid some food
before it got cold.

...But it's a secret.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whaa! The crying's stopped, but
there's still something wrong with
my eyes.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He's supposed to be dead...
yet I see Darmani standing right
before my own eyes.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...It is you.

Y-you can have the food I hid in
chandelier up there, so p-please,
j-just die in peace.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Aiee!

Y-you can have the food I hid in
the chandelier up there, so
p-please, j-just die in peace.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's cold...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Being the gatekeeper in this cold
is h-h-hard.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you want to enter the Goron
Shrine?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Then I'll open the door with a
Goron Pound.

I'm going to close it right away so
it doesn't get cold inside, so hurry
up and get in.
Are you ready?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you sure?
It's a little bit warmer inside.
Ohhh, I want to go in, too.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The door's already open.
I'm going to close it right away,
so hurry up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're Darmani! How?
You're alive?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you want me to open it again?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whoa-oh-oh!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Up here! Up here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I am sorry to bother you from
such a high place...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But I am very hungry, and I have
gotten stuck here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ooooh...It is so cold...
I am so very hungry. I don't think
I'm going to make it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I just want to eat once more
before I die up here.
Something tough and hard to
chew...
I cannot forget that flavor...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I am quite thankful, but...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I cannot eat something like this...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Th-That's it! It's so good that I
dream about it...
Dodongo Cavern's finest quality
rock sirloin!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is my absolute favorite!
Blessed be this meal!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ohhhhhhh!!!
My energy has returned to me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I am coming down now.
Wait one moment!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh!
I wondered who it might be.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why if it isn't Darmani!
You are...alive?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Yes, I see.
That is the reason why you knew
my favorite food.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, I almost forgot. Please accept
this as a token of gratitude...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thanks to you, my energy has
returned.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is a token of my gratitude.
Please accept it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It was crafted so well that no
one would even think twice if you
were to direct the frog choir.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I hope that spring will come soon
so that I can hear the frogs'
enthusiastic performance.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hope as I might, it's still cold.
I'm going back to Goron Village...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Truthfully, I thought of giving you
this mask that I am wearing...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But one can never have too many
Rupees.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Too much cold is another story.
I'm going back to Goron Village.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I have been waiting for you, Don
Gero.

Forgive me if I'm mistaken, but it
looks like you've lost a little
weight...

As you can see, Don Gero, the
long winter has ended and spring
has finally come to these
mountains.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Let us begin our chorus.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Unfortunately, it seems not all of
our members have gathered.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Perhaps it is because winter was
too long? They must not have
realized that spring has come to
the mountains...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And when the great Don Gero has
come for us, too...What a pity.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Where in the world could the
other members be, and what could
they be doing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The conducting was spectacular.
And all of our members rose to
the occasion!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is how deeply we were moved
by your spectacular conducting...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Let us do it again sometime.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, if it isn't the great Don
Gero.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Shall we sing once again?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah! Don Gero!
It has been so long.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What has brought you all this
way?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Could it be...
Has spring finally come to the
mountains?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That look...It is true!
Winter was so long that I began
to lose all hope.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I understand.
I shall head for the mountains
immediately.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Could it be...
You came all this way looking for
me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah! You need not say a thing.
Upon seeing that face,
I understand!

...Is it true?
But I had heard that it was still
winter in the mountains...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
When spring comes, I shall
definitely go to the mountains,
so...
Let us meet again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hello?
You are Don Gero!!!
It has been so long!

Just as you instructed, I came
here to start up the frog's choir
as soon as spring arrived.

But spring doesn't seem to be
coming and none of the choir have
gathered!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
To make matters worse, I grew so
hungry I could not move and found
myself in quite a fix.

I shall return the Rupees you gave
me, so permit me to go back to
the Goron Village.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I apologize for not being able to
keep my promise!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hunh? What was I doing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah!
It's already this late?!?
I must hurry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hunh?
You're one we don't see around
here much. Have you some
business with an Elder like me?
Hmm...But I haven't the time to
join you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?
You want to know what has me so
rushed?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's this cold snap brought on by
the disturbances at Snowhead that
has crippled the village and frozen
it in an icy grip...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's the lack of goods and
supplies that is leading to the
depopulation of Goron Village.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And above all, it's the image of
my own poor son, crying
continually because of this biting
cold.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
As the Elder, I must do something
about the situation the village has
been plunged into.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But this is our problem!
We shall not rely on the strength
of strangers...
Kah!...Kah!...KOFF!
Mmmph...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is our problem!
We will not rely on the strength
of strangers.
Kah!...Kah!...KOFF!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hunh???
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! You're Darmani!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But you're supposed to be dead!
Am I hallucinating?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Maybe this is also the doing of
Snowhead's magic power...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmmph...
I've been made a fool of!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But...that's impossible. I refuse to
flinch. If I can see past the
illusion, you'll vanish in an
instant!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
No matter how long you follow me,
it's not going to do you any good.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...What?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
My son is crying because he
misses me??
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why do you know that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
My son misses me...

Ulp! Forgive me, my child!
Your father has work to do!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani...
Be you a ghost or a figment of
my imagination, I no longer care.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you feel pity for my crying
son...

then please quietly sing my son to
sleep with this song I am about to
play on my drum.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It is the very same melody that
was often played for you when
you were young...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's not that I forgot it. It's just
so cold that I can't play very
well...

...At any rate, I am counting on
you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh?

...Let me play it once more.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I am counting on you to take care
of my son!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How does this song go?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Umm...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah, yes, yes! Like this!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's no good!
I can remember only the
beginning!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! Welcome to spring in Goron
Village!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're just in time...
We're holding the Goron Races in
celebration of spring, so go see
them!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! Darmani!
I've been waiting impatiently for
you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I have been waiting for your
arrival ever since I heard the
news...

I had heard that you, the one
whom I once thought to be dead,
had sealed off the blizzard that
was blowing in from Snowhead.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thanks to you, spring has come
to Goron Village. Everyone is
pleased!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The greatest Goron hero of all?
That's...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The immortal Goron who
is not dead, even if he has died?
That's...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The star whom we wish upon?
That's...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani, greatest of Gorons!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Greatest of Gorons!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani is the greatest in the
world!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Greatest in the world!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
My son got better immediately.
He went to see the Goron Races
that celebrate spring.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This time, I, the protector of this
tribe for so many years, choose
to yield the seat of tribal
patriarch to a younger one.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Goron who makes calm
decisions, yet boasts courageous
determination and can take care
of all shall be the patriarch!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The chosen one, Darmani...
is you! There could be no other!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...What do you think? If it's you,
everyone would happily accept you
as the patriarch.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What? You need not answer so
quickly. Go, enter the Goron Race.
Think it over slowly. I am awaiting
a thoughtful response.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Come back to me with your
decision after you have entered
the Goron Race and thought about
it carefully.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
My son should be anxiously
awaiting your arrival.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now, quickly go beyond the Twin
Islands Cave after leaving Goron
Village.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Spring has finally come to Goron
Village. Please go see the Goron
Races held in honor of spring. 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani!
The Goron Elder has been waiting
impatiently for you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani!
Are you going to enter the Goron
Races, too?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm going right away, too, so leave
some prizes for me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Spring has finally come to Goron
Village. It's just starting to get
comfortably warm. It feels nice.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani!
The Goron Elder has been waiting
impatiently for you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani!
You really are alive!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm feeling like a complete fool. 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Spring has finally come to Goron
Village. Bombs, the Goron's special
product, are now cheap, so you
should go buy some.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani!
The Goron Elder has been waiting
for you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani!
You did it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's just like you to pretend to
be dead just so your enemies will
let their guard down.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you already have bombs,
the special product of the
Gorons?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There's a Goron in this village who
sells Powder Kegs, which are much
more powerful explosives.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you're interested, you should
drop by Goron Village Cave.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani!
The Goron Elder is waiting
impatiently for you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani!
So you're alive after all!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I was so completely fooled that
I even made a grave for you.
I'm so dumb.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Spring has finally come to Goron
Village. Now we can dig up the
rock sirloin that had been beneath
the ice.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But that has nothing to do with
you. Sorry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani!
The Goron Elder is waiting
impatiently for you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani!
You...You are alive.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You always did say, "I cannot die
until I've eaten 1000 tons of rock
sirloin!"
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You...Do you know much
about the moon?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's just that, lately, I think the
moon has been getting bigger.
I couldn't help but notice it. What
do you think?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani!
The Goron Elder is waiting
impatiently for you!

Darmani, you sure are amazing,
but...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But somehow...I still have a bad
feeling about things...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You...You feel it too, don't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's spring! It's spring!
I can't sit still any longer!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani! Are you ready? I'm rarin'
to go!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Spring has finally come!
I have been waiting for this
moment.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This year is my debut at the
races...Please go easy on
me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Since it has warmed up...
my spirits have lifted!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This year, I'm feeling a little
different...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Watch my race!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Darmani!
Are you entering after all?
...I guess I'll be last again.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is the grave where a Goron
hero rests.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I came here to put up the great
hero's memorial...

But the return route has been
blocked by snow, and I can't get
back to Goron Village.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And even worse, my brother has
been frozen solid from the cold.

The way things are looking, I'll be
frozen, too.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ohhhh...It's times like this that
make me wish I had taken some of
the hot spring water I found when
I was digging the hero's grave.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But the hot spring is now covered
by the gravestone. I can't move a
gravestone that big by myself.

But I guess this is what's meant
by the Goron saying, "There's no
use in crying over split rocks."
...Brrrrrr.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
H-h-hooo. If only I had water from
the hot spring beneath the great
hero's grave...then I could melt the
ice off of my brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Y-you're...No! No, you're not
the great Darmani, are you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Then...just whose grave was I
making?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you come back to life
because it was so warm beneath
your grave?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There used to be a hot spring
bubbling beneath the great
Darmani's grave.
 
If I had some of that hot spring
water, I might be able to thaw out
my frozen brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hunh?
What have I been doing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh!!! Are you all right, brother?
You were frozen, but the great
Darmani saved you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The great Darmani?!
What's with you? Are you half
asleep?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you hear this guy?
The great Darmani died long ago
and is lying in his gr...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Heeee!!! Darmani!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I was shocked, too.
But somehow, it seems the great
Darmani isn't dead.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
R-Really?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
With this, a star of hope appears
in Goron Village.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Great Darmani! Please do
something about the blizzard
blowing in from Snowhead!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! Are you all right, brother?
You were frozen and this person
saved you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Frozen?!
...I was?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Really? I don't know who you
are, but thank you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But besides that, it turns out the
great Darmani is alive!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What's this?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I was shocked, too, but somehow
it seems the great Darmani is not
dead.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Really?
If that's true, then a glimmer of
hope has appeared in Goron
Village.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's true! Surely the great
Darmani can do something about
the blizzard that blows in from
Snowhead.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Great Darmani!
Hurry! Please do something about
the blizzard blowing in from
Snowhead.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Great Darmani!
Have you seen the Goron Elder
yet?

If you haven't, you should go see
him soon. I'm sure he'll be very
happy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you know the great
Darmani? He is the greatest hero
of the Goron tribe. He is our
last hope.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Have you seen the great
Darmani? No one can withstand
his punching and pounding.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
H-h-hoooo...It's cold.
This cold has me hallucinating
about Darmani. I can't take it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
H-h-hoooo...It's cold.
This cold has me seeing Darmani's
ghost...Y-Yikes...
I th-think I'll go freeze again...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thank you for saving my brother.

But something has to be done
about this cold. Otherwise, we'll
be Goronsicles.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
H-h-hoooo...It's cold.
I wonder if we'll ever be able to
return to Goron Village.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is great.
The Elder's son has finally quit
crying. Now we can sleep, too.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We're at our wits' end...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Elder went to Snowhead and
doesn't seem to be coming back.
Now his son is so lonely that he
won't stop crying.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It keeps getting colder outside,
and inside we're so cold we could
freeze.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Those sideburns...Aren't you
Darmani? You're supposed to be
dead...but you're alive?

The Elder was troubled because he
thought you were dead.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm troubled, too...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Elder went to Snowhead and
hasn't come back, so now his son
is so lonely he won't stop crying.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you don't find the Goron Elder
and ask him to come back...I'll
never be able to sleep.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And it just keeps getting colder
outside...Even in here it is so cold
that we could freeze.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
At his age, the Elder couldn't
have gotten very far.

I fear that he may be frozen out
there...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is nice.
The Elder's son has finally stopped
crying. Now we can sleep, too.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is the room of the Goron
Tribe's Elder.

Do you have some kind of
business with the Elder?
Unfortunately, he's out.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Since the Elder is gone, his son
won't stop crying. I wish someone
would do something...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Those sideburns...Aren't 
you Darmani? You're supposed to
be dead...but you're alive?
What have you been doing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thinking you were dead, the Elder
went to Snowhead on his own...

But for now, please go see the
Elder's son. Hurry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Elder's son is in there.
...This crying is heartbreaking.
Will it ever stop?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

This store is having trouble
getting product because of the
cold. Things are kind of expensive
now, so you shouldn't shop here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Waaa...Hunh, ugh...u-waahhh!
Da-daaaddy, daaaddy! Hunh...
I'm cooooold...Daaaddy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Hyunh, hunh...
Ahh, Darmi, where's my daddy?
Where's my daddy?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Waaah...Henh, uwaaaaah...
Daaaaaddy, daaaddy...H-hunh...
I'm cooold, Daaaddy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That song...That's the song daddy
always plays for me before I
go to sleep...
I'll sing the next part.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mmmmm...
It's just like...daddy's...
right...beside me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Zzzzz...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah, Darmi!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now that it's nice and warm out,
I'm much, much better.

Even if my daddy isn't right beside
me, I won't be selfish and cry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So...now that spring has come, the
Goron Races should be starting
soon.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But this rock is in the way, so I
can't get in to see the race...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And spring's just started, too...
I was so excited...but there's
nothing I can do...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I hate it! I hate it!
I wanna see it!
I wanna see it!
I wanna see the race!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Break it! Break it!
I wanna go to the race!
I wanna go to the race!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you come to play?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you can, you should go see the
Goron races that are gonna be
held on the other side of this
mountain.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Way to go, Darmi!
That was cooool!

C'mon! If we don't hurry, the race
will start. C'mon! Hurry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Goron Races that honor the
coming of spring are about to
begin.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's a really, really cool race, so
you should watch it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Once you see these Goron races,
you'll wish you were born a Goron.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah! Darmi!
I've been waiting for you.

See, everyone's restless 'cause
they can't wait to enter. You're
gonna enter, aren't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're gonna enter aren't you?
 
Yep
Nope
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...You used to like racing more
than you liked gobbling up a third
helping of rock sirloin...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Darmi I know would never
back out of a race...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I hate it!
I wanna watch you race!
I wanna! I wanna! I wanna!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...You really do want to race.
I know you do.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You have to! I want to show
everyone how Darmi races!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If your magic power runs low,
charge it up with the green jars
on the course.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That was great!
I knew you were the fastest
Goron, Darmi!

I was sure you'd get first place!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is from daddy...
It's the prize.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I wanna be just like you--quick!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...You're just a little stiff because
winter was so long.

You're not really like this.

Remember how good you really
are, then enter the races again.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, but if you don't have an
empty bottle to keep the prize in,
you can't enter...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Everyone, one entrant made a
false start, so we must restart
the race.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Can you hear me, Darmi? Umm...
I'm sorry, but there's no way you
can win now...

Do you want to keep racing
anyway?
Of course!
No...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
C'mon...Enter the race.
I want to show everybody how
fast you are.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You did it!
Thanks a lot!

I'm going right in. I'll be waiting
for you, so you have to come
see it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
They're late!
What are those Zoras doing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmm? What is it, boy?
Did you also come to watch the
Zora eggs hatch?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm excited about it, too, but
those important eggs haven't
arrived yet...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It takes about one to three days
from the time Zora eggs are laid
for them to hatch.

But if they aren't kept in this
aquarium until then...they may die.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The reason for this is that the
recent abnormal weather has
caused the ocean temperature to
rise in this region.
Zora eggs are very sensitive to
changes in the temperature.
The only way the eggs can hatch
is if they're placed in this
aquarium water, which I set aside
for them long ago.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Zoras are well aware of
this, but they're still late.
I wonder if something has
happened at Zora Hall?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
They're late!
What are those Zoras doing?
If they don't hurry, the eggs will
die.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is a problem. Zora eggs won't
hatch unless all eggs that were
laid at the same time are brought
together.
What are those Zoras doing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What are you doing here? You
look a little out of place at the
ocean, don't you think?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The seas around here are too
warm and aren't suitable for you
to splash around in.

If you don't have any business
here, then be on your way.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
These seas are too warm for you
to splash around in. If you haven't
any business here, then be on
your way.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And besides, the more I think
about it, the funnier it looks
seeing a fellow like you at the
ocean.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What are you doing? Don't you at
least shut your mouth when you're
listening to people?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The seas around here are too
warm and aren't suitable for you
to splash around in.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you really getting what I'm
saying to you when you just stand
there with your mouth wide open?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What happened to the rest of the
eggs? The eggs can't hatch if
they aren't all together.

Hurry! Find the rest of the eggs
and put them in the aquarium.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, you finally came? I've been
waiting for you. What about the
eggs?

I heard there is a total of seven...
Hurry! Put them in that aquarium.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you don't hurry, the eggs will
die. Quickly! Put them in that
aquarium!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Good. All of the eggs have been
brought together.
...It's going to start. Quick! Come
to the front of the aquarium!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
L-look at this! What does this
mean...What in the world could
this mean?

...I've got it!

Don't you understand? The way
these Zora children have lined
up...It means...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You...Don't you have some kind of
instrument?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
......
Nothing. Not a thing. Could it be
you're using the wrong
instrument?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That! Yes, it's that instrument!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmm...
If these Zoras were born to teach
this song, then hurry!

You must play this song for the
Zora who laid these eggs!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I will take good care of the Zora
children. You go find the Zora
who laid these eggs! Quickly!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...This is a very strange thing.

If Zora children can teach music,
then the Zora still hold many
mysteries.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What happened?
Just what kind of song was that?

You must know something, don't
you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I don't understand what happened,
but it seems the ocean has
reclaimed its serenity.

Could this somehow be related to
that song? You know something,
don't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The ocean's temperature has
returned to normal. Did you come
here to splash around in the sea?

If you drown trying to swim with
a big ol' body like that, don't
blame me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The ocean's temperature has
returned to normal. Did you come
here to spash around in the sea?

If you try swimming with that
puny body, you'll be sorry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If they don't hurry, the eggs will
soon die. What could the Zoras be
doing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh, yeah! That hot sound shoots

Carve my farewell song on my

I'm depending on you to help that

Herein lies Mikau, the legendary
guitarist of the Zora tribe. He is
to be remembered in song, and his
lyrics are written here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Will you try to sing Mikau's
lyrics?

 
1. We the Zora
2. Zora Fight Song
I won't sing
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Sharp fins are the mark of the

We can even dive by pressing (B)!
Oh-oh...We the Zora.

Lulu's Diary
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It has been two days since I have
lost my voice.

I don't want Mikau to know, so I
talked to Evan about it.

He recommended that I take the
eggs to the Marine Research Lab
to have them checked.

I think I will take them right
away.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Such a terrible thing has happened
today that I don't even know
where to begin writing.

I heard a sound late at night, and
when I opened my eyes, I saw
strangers in my room.

I tried to fight, but they were
able to steal my precious eggs.

It seems I lost consciousness
after that.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Today, I told everything to Mikau,
the one person whom I didn't
want to know about it.

At first, I was too embarrassed
and too sad to do anything.

And with the words that Mikau
said at that moment, I felt that
all hope had been lost.

But please, Mikau, I'm begging you,
don't do anything rash.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
.........
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That sad face is trying to tell you
something.
...You can see it in her
expression!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mikau, what's going on?

And my voice...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What happened to me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Who are you?
Mikau...Where's Mikau?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mm...Mm...Yeeeaaawn!
I slept quite well!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I just realized this when I opened
my eyes. The passing of days is
quite quick. Isn't it, Lulu?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yes, Lulu. It's nothing to be
surprised at.

Although my eyes were closed in
sleep, I still see everything that
occurs in this ocean...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Hmm.
It seems Lulu is confused.
Regrettably, there is no time for
idle conversation.
Now then, proud Zora warrior...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The open seas of Great Bay have
need of your might.

Quickly. Climb onto my back.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why so slow?
Hurry up and fire your hookshot
into the palm tree on my back,
Link.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Heh, heh, heh.
Of course I know your name.
Didn't I say that all is seen by
me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You seem to be having a bit of
trouble...

Are you still not used to your
Zora body?

Perhaps it would be quicker to
give up.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you are once again ready to
depart, then climb onto my back.

Ready, Link?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What's wrong?
Returning to shore?

Hyeh, hyeh.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It is not shameful to retreat. That
in and of itself is a strategy.

All right. Climb onto my back.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now I can continue resting in
peace. I too must abide the laws
of ancient times and again merely
watch from my deep slumber.
But the evil that haunts this land
has not completely vanished,
Link. I shall depart after
enjoying Lulu's voice a bit longer.
I think the gods can permit that.
Hyeh, hyeh, hyeh.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Pleased to meet you. I'm Lulu.

Please come to our concert in
town.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I guess being able to sing is a
wonderful thing, after all...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mikau!
You came back safely!

That's good...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I was surprised when my voice
turned that lonely island into a 
turtle... 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But that song you played for
me...My mother used to sing it
often...long ago...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Those eggs were laid to remind me
of that.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That song was from when I was a
very young child, so I had
forgotten it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I've put you through some horrible
experiences, Mikau.

But I'm all better now!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, the town's concert is very
soon.

Let's start our rehearsal!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
One... two... three...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Are you going to the temple
again?

If there is something left to do,
then quickly climb onto my back.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
P--p-please...
My soul...
Heal it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You have strange powers,
Link. I have a request for
you. Please follow me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Here in the depths of Pinnacle
Rock live many dangerous sea
snakes...

My friend is trapped here.

Link, can you please find a
way to rid the area of all the sea
snakes and help my friend?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Please do this for me. Please
defeat all the vicious sea snakes
and save my friend.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Please follow me closely without
making any missteps.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you try to go beyond Pinnacle
Rock, you'll get lost in the murky
water.

Before you know it, you'll find
yourself back where you started,
so be careful.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thank you, Link.
This is a symbol of my deepest
gratitude.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Help me...
Please, take me back to the
waters near Pinnacle Rock...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you interested in that fish?

It's a rare fish, isn't it?
It's called a sea horse.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I caught it swimming around here.
Just off of Pinnacle Rock.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Since it's rare, I was thinking of
selling it at the town carnival,
which should be starting soon.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you want, I'll give it to you.

On one condition...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you have a pictograph of the
female pirates?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you want that sea horse, bring
me a pictograph of a female
pirate.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! That's my hookshot that the
pirates stole!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...If you have it, then that means
you've been to the Pirates'
Fortress.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
In that case, you've got one, don't
you? Don't hide it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What's this? I guess you don't
have one after all.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Technically, I do have a pictograph
of a female pirate, but it's all
blurry and it's not that great...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The all-important face...I can't see
it very well!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! That's it! That's it!
I had a picture like that.

Well, aren't you a crafty one?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You'll give that to me, won't you?

In exchange, I'll give you this!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thank you.
Hurry! Take me back to the
waters near Pinnacle Rock...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
With pictographs, the sepia tone
conveys a lot more emotion than
color. Isn't it great?

This picture you gave me is gonna
be one of my treasures.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, if it isn't a Zora?
How have things been going
lately?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Har-harrr!
...Could you be coming to see me
'cause you can't catch any fish?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's not good out there...
Lately, I've been coming back
empty-handed myself.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why, I was almost hoping you
were coming to share with me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sorry, but I don't have any fish to
share with you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I've been catching fish in these
seas for 30 years.

When it comes to catching fish,
I'm even better than the Zoras.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...That's what I'd like to be saying,
anyway.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Lately, the seawater has gotten
really warm.

It hasn't helped my fishing at all...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And what's worse, this water has
gotten murky, so when I ship out,
I always lose my way and
somehow end up back at shore.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We fishermen--and even the
fish--are in a real predicament!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If the seas don't return to normal
soon...

The Zoras...and even I...will be
all dried up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Heh-heh! Isn't she pretty?

But, you know...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Those female pirates are so
frightening, they could scare a
crying baby into silence...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
See, it was long ago when I used
to use this thing called a
hookshot to catch fish off the
coast...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But I was attacked by these
pirates, and they took it away
with them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
They say...
it's a legendary treasure..
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And I just happened to swipe it
from the bottom of the sea, so I
hold no grudge against 'em.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It may be a treasure resting
somewhere in the Pirates' Fortress
at the edge of this coast.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The security at the Pirates'
Fortress is tight. Sneaking in is
no easy task.

If you're set on meeting those
beautiful pirates, try going to the
valley on the other side of town!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I've heard there's a mask there
that lets the wearer escape
detection.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Come to think of it, there was a
Zora floating lifelessly out in the
bay...

But there's probably no helping him
now...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, sorry! Evenings and the first
thing in the morning are my break
times. Come back later.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now that the seas are back to
normal, I've started a little
business aimed at tourists.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you pay 20 Rupees, I'll invite
you to a jumping game that has a
really big prize!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you're up for it, go to that
island in the center.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, you're up for it!

Now then, I'll explain the rules, so
listen carefully.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm going to light the torches on
each of the surrounding four
islands in a particular order.

Jump to the island that has the
lit torch. If you can jump to it
before the torch goes out, you'll
get one point!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you get 20 or more points
within the time limit, you'll get a
big prize! But it'll cost you
20 Rupees for one try.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How about it? Will you give it a
try?
Sure
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Aw, that's too bad!
And it's so fun, too.
You're missing out...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmmm...
You don't have enough Rupees.
Maybe next time.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Great!
In that case, I'll start.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, that's out of bounds. That's
against the rules!

Huh? Didn't I tell you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, yeah...
If you fall, then that's that.
You'll have to try again.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
All right...That's it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What do you think?
It's harder than it seems, isn't it?

Some things in this world just
look easy until you try them. But I
know you'll try again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Uh-oh!
That was a little too easy...
Oh well, here's your prize!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And I was thinking of saving up
to buy a big ship...

Now it looks like I may go
bankrupt!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thank you for saving me.

I know it may be asking too much,
but I have a request for you,
brave one.

Please bring back my friend who
was caught by the fisherman.

I beg you. You're the only one I
can rely on.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Any good picture of a pirate will
do--even a snapshot of a guard.
Can't you help me out?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, and if you're going to the
Pirates' Fortress, don't forget to
take your pictograph box.

...Ah, well, it's not that you have
to take it...
Heh, heh, heh...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, too bad.
You don't have an empty bottle to
keep the sea horse in!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Umm...
Well, this certainly is a pirate...

But I can't be pleased with a shot
that looks like this.

Bring me one that's a better shot
of a pirate.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You again?
You can't fool me with your
green clothes!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You want an empty bottle, don't
you? You never learn your lesson!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Koo, koo, koo.
OK, I'll give you one. 

But...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Only if you can swim through all
the rings in the river in under
two minutes.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So, do you wanna try?
 
Sure
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The way out is over there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Koo, koo, koo.
If you want an empty bottle, I can
give you one...

But only if you can swim through
all the rings in the river in under
two minutes.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There's a total of 20 rings. You
must swim through them in the
right order for it to count. Swim
through the ring that's flashing.
I'll show you the way, so follow
me and don't get separated!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK...Time's up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Want to try again?
 
Sure
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The way out is over there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You cheated, didn't you?
You didn't get all the rings!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wanna try again?
 
Sure
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The way out is over there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Uh...That was perfect.

That's not good...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you call me, little brother?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I called you, big brother!
Actually...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?
An empty bottle?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yeah...
An empty bottle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
......

Don't worry, little brother!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
To us, empty bottles are a
treasure.

I can't give you one just because
you beat my little brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We can't just give you one.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'll give you one after you race
once more against me.

So, will you try?
 
Sure
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He says he won't do it, little
brother!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He's no fun. He's just a stick
in the mud.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The rules are the same, but this
time there are 25 rings.

Don't fall behind!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You cheated, didn't you?
You didn't get all the rings!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You didn't clear them all!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Want to try once more?
 
Sure
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Koo, koo, koo.
He says he won't do it, little
brother!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Koo, koo, koo.
That's right, big brother!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He did it, little brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yeah, he did it, big brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There's nothing we can do, little
brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
......
This is a mess, big brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We underestimated you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He's back, little brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yeah, he's back, big brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But we don't have any more empty
bottles...do we, little brother?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
No, we don't have any, big
brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you say you still want to race,
though, that's fine.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What will you do?
 
I'll Race
I won't race
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The way out is over there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
First, you have to start with my
little brother. This time, the limit
is 1:50.

Don't fall behind!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

He did it again, big brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...That's shameful, little brother.

Now race me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What will you do?
 
I'll race
I won't race
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I guess he's just a stick in
the mud, little brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Surprising, isn't it, big
brother?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The time limit is the same as it
was for my little brother--1:50.
...But there are 25 rings this time.

Don't fall behind!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He's a formidable opponent, little
brother!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're all just talk, eh, big
brother?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If we give THAT to him, I wonder
if he'll leave us alone, little
brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yeah, I want to quit, big brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Please! Let it be over.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
First, you must race my little
brother. This time around, you
have to beat 1:40.

Don't fall behind!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The time limit is the same as it
was for my little brother--1:40.
But now there are 25 rings.

Don't fall behind!

____________________________________
Huh? The moon?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's gotten bigger again.
Th-this is bad...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I thought I heard some loud noises
inside, and I came in to check it
out...

This place...
Is this some sort of underground
shelter?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you find this place?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I beg you! Let me have this
place! Not for free, of course.
I hope this will do...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm just glad it was something you
needed...

Anyhow, I won't be needing it
much longer anyway... 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's my life's fortune. If you'll
let me have this place for that
much, it'll be worth it.

Anyhow, the need for Rupees will
soon be gone...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I thought I heard loud noises
coming from here, and when I
came to take a look...

I had no idea this place was
here...I'll be safe here for sure.
I'm glad I found it early.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I had no idea there was a
basement here...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If only you could have done
something about this place
yesterday...

I could have given you a wallet
that holds more Rupees...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's my life savings. If I can
buy safety with it, then it's
worth it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's my life savings. If I can
buy safety with it, then it's worth
it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I had no idea this place was
here...Perhaps, it just might keep
me safe. I'm just glad I found it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I heard loud noises coming from
inside and was worried, but when I
came to check it out...

I never thought I'd find a place
like this...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But dang, if only you could have
done something two days ago...

I could have given you a wallet
that holds more Rupees...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, that's all I have on me...
I hope it's enough.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, that's all I have on me.
I hope it's enough...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There's no time left.
Hurry! We have to hide...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Only a little more than two days
left...Oh, Goddess of Time, please
save me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Only a little more than one day
left...Oh, Goddess of Time, please
save me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Only a little time left...Oh,
Goddess of Time, please save me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah! Captain, sir! It's been a long
time since we've seen you!

As you have ordered, sir, we are
investigating the secrets of this
place.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
According to the information I
have obtained, it seems á
should be shot first!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

According to the information I

should be shot second!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
According to the information I

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Have I fulfilled my duties, sir?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ahh! Thank you, sir!
I hope the information I have
provided will be of assistance to
you, sir.
Now, as you ordered, sir, I will
finish the last of my duties.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yessir!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I-Is that so, sir?
Uh...I apologize, sir!

I shall continue my investigation!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, you!
Halt!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I've been waiting for you!

And, did you find the rest of the
eggs?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...N-No.
B-But...that's beca...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What are you trying to pull
here?!?

If people hear the great pirates
have lost the treasure they stole,
we'll become the laughing stock!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yes, b-but Aveil...

The sea is strangely murky where
we were attacked by the sea
snakes...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Silence!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's why the Zoras can't send
for any help!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now that the eggs are gone, the
Zoras should be frantically
searching for them.

If we don't hurry, the Zoras will
get to them before we do!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There are four eggs here now.

Hurry! Go find the other three
eggs before those sea snakes eat
them!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Understood...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wait!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Zora eggs are the only clue
we have about that dragon cloud
floating over the bay...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If what that strange, masked one
says is true...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And if we can get our hands on
the treasure that lies sleeping in
the temple in that dragon cloud...

Then we can spend the rest of
our lives living the good life!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So get a move on and go find
them! Now!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Understood!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Halt!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It takes courage to come thieving
in the Pirates' Fortress!

I'm going to love doing this to
you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ugh.
Don't think it ends here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmph! You're nothing to talk
about...Come back and try me
again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's as far as you go!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How unfortunate. You won't be
getting past here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ugh! Not bad...
But don't think it ends here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmph!
We're not to be made fools of!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We aren't fooled by that mask!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you think you can trick us
with that mask?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Halt!
Everyone!!!
A rat has snuck in!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Halt!
Everyone! A rat wearing a
strange mask has snuck in!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What's with you?

This room belongs to Japas, the
genius bassist of the Zora Band.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Go through my manager if you
want my autograph.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The concert's coming soon. Let's
forget about our bandmates and
their messed-up problems and
have a jam session of our own.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mikau!!!

Where've ya been?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm all, like, "Hey, where's Mikau?
The concert's comin' up soon!"

And now our band leader has
pulled a vanishing act--Evan's all
holed up in his room just writin'
songs...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And to top it off, Lulu just
stands out back starin' at the
sea. She doesn't even respond
when ya talk to her.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you guys think it's just 'cause
Lulu's not interested in me, I'd
understand, but I'm tellin' ya, it
looks like somethin's really wrong.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Is there somethin' you're trying to
hide from me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm not runnin' an inquiry or
anything...

But, look...If we don't start
rehearsin' real soon, we're not
gonna be ready for the concert.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What were the other band
members doing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You do know that if we don't
start rehearsing, we're not gonna
be ready for the concert, right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey...Why don't we forget about
waiting for Evan to write a song
and just write one ourselves?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you feel up to it, let's have a
little jam session.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you play our song for Evan?
What did he say?

Don't tell me...

You didn't forget the song, did
you?
Yeah, I did
No, I didn't
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, in that case, hurry up and
play Evan our song.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, man. In that case, I guess we
have to have another jam session.
Are ya ready?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh?
You wanna have a jam session?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Try following this phrase I wrote
on your guitar.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Here we go...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whoooa...
That's niiiice.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I got it! I got it! I got it!
Here I go!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's got a good feel to it! Even
Evan should like this.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But...

He's so proud...He'd resent the
fact that we wrote somethin' on
our own. I don't think he'd even
let the others try it out.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whaddya think we should do?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How can we, like, make sure that
Evan doesn't find out that it was
us who wrote this song?

Can't you think of anything?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That melody's bogus, man!

What's wrong? You're not jammin'
like you usually do!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You wanna stop?
 
Yeah
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You in a slump?
Don't worry about it...

Those were the kind of notes an
amateur would play while tryin' to
figure out the notes as he goes...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Once you're back in the groove,
we'll write a song that'll knock
Evan off his flippers!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
When you're in a slump, all ya
can do is go back to your room
and sleep on it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's uncool, man...
What are you tryin' to do, walkin'
into people's rooms like that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you wanna have a jam session
with me usin' that instrument?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sorry, but try somethin' else.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mikau?
Where've you been? Where've you
been? I was worried.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The concert in town is coming up,
but it seems like all the band
members are in a funk. I betcha
didn't know that, huh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Especially Lulu.
I haven't heard her voice in a long
time.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
She's usually in good spirits, too.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ooh! Ooh! I wonder if this is
related to the ocean turning all
weird...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Actually...
I know a little bit of Lulu's
secret.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you wanna hear it?
 
I wanna hear it
Not really
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There's a rumor that the ocean is
getting weird 'cause there's
trouble off shore at Great Bay
Temple.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And they say when that happens,
something bad will befall the Zora
descendant who's been protecting
the temple.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you catch my drift?

And lately, Lulu has been looking
kind of weird. Maybe Lulu's the...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, yeah, that's right. There aren't
any secrets between you and Lulu.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ooh! Ooh!
Don't tell Lulu that I've been
saying stuff about her...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Um...
Don't get mad, but I want you to
hear this...

I tried to climb up the other
ladder to your practice area, and
it broke. I'm gonna go on a diet
now, so just forgive me, OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ooh! Ooh!
How's Lulu?
Is she talking to you?

Look...
It's about Lulu's secret...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh? Who are you?
You can't just come walkin' in
here.

I don't have a problem, but I think
my roommate might get mad.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Just follow the rules if you're one
of our fans.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is a problem. You just can't
come in and hang out in our
room!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Can you read Zoran script?

Mikau
My Diary

Today, Japas and I had a jam
session. He's not good with words,
but he writes great riffs.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Here's what I played:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Today, I had Lulu listen to my
session with Japas.

She seemed to like it a lot.
Lulu's a pretty great girl,
after all.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Today, I had another jam session
with Japas.

Evan was in a bad mood 'cause
the two of us are writin' songs on
our own.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Here's what I played:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Evan called me over this morning.
It was something about Lulu.

He was in a real rush. I wonder
what it could be?

By the way, it seems my lucky
color this week is green.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mikau! How was it? Did you get
the eggs back?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You did it, Mikau!

OK...Take that egg straight to the
professor at the Marine Research
Lab.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I've already talked to the
professor. Leave the rest up to
him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, thank goodness! Lulu's voice
has been brought back to normal!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I've already talked to the
professor, so after delivering the
eggs, you can leave the rest up
to him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How was it? Did the professor at
the Marine Research Lab figure
out the mystery of the eggs?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh...
You couldn't do it, after all.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Have you been to see Lulu out in
back by the ocean?

Ever since the pirates stole her
eggs, she's just been standing out
there gazing at the sea and
sighing...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Mikau!
We need those eggs safe so Lulu
can get her voice back.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We've grown accustomed to life
in a peaceful sea...

The only one among the Zora tribe
who is still able to go to blows
with those wild pirates...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It is you, with the blood of Zoran
heroes flowing within you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm still keeping Lulu's problem a
secret from the other band
members.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
They've all been looking forward to
our Carnival of Time concert.

And I can't tell them it's canceled
'cause Lulu can't sing, can I?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Anyway, Mikau, did you get an
empty bottle that you can use to
carry the eggs in?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
One bottle can only hold one egg,
so you can never have too many
empty bottles.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I told you that the beavers above
the waterfall on the Zora Hall
coast have empty bottles, right?

If you don't have any yet, Mikau,
you should go there before
heading off to the Pirates'
Fortress.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Carnival of Time concert is
quickly approaching...

Hurry up and get those eggs back
from the pirates.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I already told you the beavers
above the waterfall have empty
bottles, right?

If you don't have any yet, you
should go there before going to
the Pirates' Fortress.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What is this?
You can't just come into people's
rooms and make yourself at home!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ahh...
If Lulu's voice doesn't return,
I don't know what we can do...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey!
How did you get in here?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I shouldn't have to put up with
this...People not associated with
the band aren't allowed in here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you want an autograph, we'll be
giving them out at the town's
carnival, so wait until then.

Were you guys secretly writing a
song behind my back again?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Isn't songwriting the job of the
bandleader? What, you're not
happy with my songs?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I heard that song. If you write
any other good songs, I'd like
to hear them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh?
That song?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmmm...
It works, it works,
it works!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Not bad...
That's a pretty good song I just
made up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You've got a good sense of
melody! We'll play my new song at
our next show! Take this in
thanks!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're not thinking I'm stealing
your song, do you? 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you want an autograph, I'll give
you one after our rehearsal.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What have you been doing? You're
late, Mikau!

Ooh! Ooh!
Guess what! Lulu's voice...
She's gotten it back!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hurry up and go see Lulu.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And with that, we're all ready.
I can't wait for the town's
concert.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We've kept you waiting! Just a
little bit longer and we'll play our
hot sound for you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're late, Mikau! Where were
you while you were skippin'
practice?

Lulu's been waiting for you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What were you doing?
Hurry up and go talk to Lulu!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, Mikau...

That song Evan wrote sounds just
like the one we played at our jam
session, doesn't it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I've written a great song, so just
be patient.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You did great, Mikau.
Lulu's voice has returned.

Well, it looks like Lulu wants to
talk to you, so go see her
now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, hurry up!
We're about to start rehearsal.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm glad I got this new song done
in time for the concert.

You did great, Mikau. And even
without any practice.

You really are a musical genius...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're an unusual sight to see in
this neck of the water...

You came to see the Zora band,
The Indigo-Go's, didn't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The members of The Indigo-Go's
are in Zora Hall up ahead...

But the entrance is underwater,
so if you aren't a good diver, you
probably won't make it in.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The members of The Indigo-Go's
are up ahead in Zora Hall...

But if you can't dive deep
underwater, you won't get in.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, aren't you Mikau?
Were you able to get an empty
bottle from the beavers on top of
the waterfall?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Those guys are quick, so it's
pretty tough, isn't it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But what do you need an empty
bottle for, Mikau?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Can you break all those jars
behind me in one try?

Among us Zora, there are some
who can.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you do it, I'll give you
something good.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Anything's worth a try!
Think it over and give it a shot.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, Mikau...
You wanna do that thing you used
to always do?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You just can't play guitar all the
time. You gotta get out and move
your body once in a while.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Clock Town's carnival is coming
soon and business there is good.
That'd be nice...Things here aren't
picking up yet.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We haven't been able to catch any
fish in the ocean, so we have to
go to town to buy them.

We never had a need for Rupees
until now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I have a shop inside Zora Hall, so
actually I'd like you to go there
and buy a lot of stuff...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I don't want to sound greedy, but
I need to make money for the
jars.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We can't fish in the ocean
anymore, so everyone's going into
town to buy them instead.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But I just can't get used to the
taste of fish from a river.

But a Zora's gotta eat, so there's
no way around it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If your band does well with its
concert in town, it'll bring tourists
here and...

I won't have to ask for jar money.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Way to go, Mikau!

You've got a big smirk on your
face...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, here's 100 Rupees.

Except...
Jar replacement costs 10 Rupees,
so I'll have to deduct that.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You get 90 Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Take the challenge again sometime.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whoa!
There are others besides Zoras
who can do it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What's wrong? Have you lost your
touch from playing too much
guitar, Mikau?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Didn't you used to be able to
break all these pots at once?

Your motion was all stiff like
someone who's not used to doing
this...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sorry, but I have to take
10 Rupees for those broken jars.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, that's a problem...Don't go
breaking my jars. Those jars
aren't free, you know.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What? You don't even have
10 Rupees?

I guess there's nothing I can do...
I'll just have to eat the loss.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you break them all at once, I'll
give you something good.

Take the challenge again sometime.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is the room of Mikau and
Tijo, the guitarist and drummer for
the Zora band, The Indigo-Go's.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
They don't meet with ordinary
people.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
No way. If you want to meet
Mikau and Tijo, you'll have to go
through their manager.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, Mikau...
I haven't seen you in a while.
Where have you been?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, that's right. Evan, your
bandleader, is looking for you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Evan came by several times
looking for you. Have you seen
him yet?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is the room of Japas, bassist
for the Zora band, The Indigo-Go's.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm sorry, but he's busy practicing
for the concert, so I can't let you
see him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you're not a band member, you
can't go in...Even if you're an
acquaintance.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mikau...
Do you need to see Japas?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're gonna have another jam
session with him, aren't you?
I can't wait!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm expecting a cool performance
in your jam session with Japas.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is the room of Evan, the
leader of the Zora Band, The
Indigo-Go's.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He's a nervous guy, so nobody's
allowed inside unless they're on
official business.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Unless you have official business,
it's impossible to see him until
after the concert.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah! Mikau!
What have you been doing this
whole time?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Evan the bandleader has been
waiting for you for a while now.
Hurry! Go in! Go in!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Stop worrying the bandleader like
you do...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Shut up! I'm busy.
Don't talk to me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Shut up. I'm busy right now...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah! Mikau!
You caught me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Eee...I...uh...er, L-Lulu's been
l-looking kinda weird lately...
I was w-worried...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's not like I was s-spying on
her or anything...

I-I'm not some k-kind of weirdo or
some sorta slimy fish or anything.
...Um, yeah.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Uh...I just r-remembered that I
have somewhere to be...What time
is it? Um, yeah. I hafta be there,
like, now. Uhhh...See ya!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you come to see The
Indigo-Go's rehearse, too?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
No?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Have you heard of The
Indigo-Go's?
Of course
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I thought so. The Indigo-Go's are
pretty big now, aren't they?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Their rehearsal is about to begin,
so I thought you came to see
them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But even though their concert in
town is tomorrow, they still
haven't started rehearsing.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I wonder what they're doing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh? You don't know them?
The Indigo-Go's is that popular
band that's going to be doing a
concert in town soon!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
They've got Evan, the keyboard
king, the thumping bass of Japas,
the cool drum beat of Tijo...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But above all, Mikau's weeping
guitar and the shimmering voice of
Lulu make the best songs!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah, you're Mikau, right? Good luck
practicing for the concert!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm looking forward to your 
rehearsal.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Aren't you going to rehearse?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Or are you just gonna hit the
stage without any practice?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hohhh!
That's a real genius guitarist!
So bold!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The stage lights turned on! The
rehearsal's gotta start soon.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ahh...Lulu!
Hurry up and show your face on
stage!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you come here to see The
Indigo-Go's 'cause you couldn't
wait for the concert?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I heard they were having a
rehearsal, and I've been waiting
here ever since.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But the stage lights aren't even
lit, so it looks like it'll be a while
before rehearsals start.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I wonder when they're gonna
start? C'mon, I want to see my
Lulu.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah! Mikau!
Hey, what's Lulu doing now?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm so jealous of you! To always
be able to breathe the same air
as Lulu...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And you know a side of Lulu that
I don't...You know her private side,
don't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's wonderful. I won't ask you
to introduce me. A pictograph will
do. Show me Lulu's private side.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you by chance bring something
of Lulu's?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If it's about Lulu, I want to know
everything. I'll take anything...You
know? I'm the consummate fan!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmmm...This isn't that great, but
I'll buy it off you anyway.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Next time, bring me a better shot
that really captures Lulu.
If you do that...
I'll do you no wrong.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! Lulu's face.
It's irresistible!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Please let me have this!
OK? OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Keep the change.

For this kind of pictograph, I'll
take as many as you have, so
bring more!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, you can't do that. No
climbing up on the rehearsal
stage.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We're doin' the sound check right
now, so don't make any noise.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hurry up and get off the stage.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mikau, you're just in time. I want
to check the levels on your
guitar.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Can you play me a note?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mikau, can you play me a quick
note?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ack!
That's a little too loud.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I guess I'll turn it down a bit...

OK. Thanks, Mikau.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh?
That's a little too quiet...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I guess I'll turn it up a bit...

OK. Thanks, Mikau.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wha? They're off again. That's a
problem...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you free? If you have a sec,
could you go light the second
floor's seating lights?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Unless those are on, the stage
lights won't come on.
Thanks.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you the one who turned those
lights on?

You saved me.
Here...Go buy whatever you like!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
All right...The lights are all good.
Now we just have to wait...
But they'll probably go out 
again pretty soon...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What do you want, Mikau?
Are you checking the stage?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I don't know why, but there's
something wrong with the
lighting...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The lighting isn't working right.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mikau...
How do you like it? The lights are
perfect.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now hurry up and do start your
rehearsal before the lights go out.
Hurry! Hurry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hurry and start your rehearsal
before the lights go out.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh? Here too? This is a problem.
Rehearsal hasn't started yet, so I
guess it's OK, but...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Once rehearsal starts, you'll have
to buy a ticket!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Indigo-Go's is a wildly popular
band right now.

If we don't sell tickets to their
rehearsals, too, we'll end up with
tons of people showing up.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Once the rehearsal starts, you'll
have to buy a ticket. You just
can't go and take a seat.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oy! Mikau! What's up with the
rehearsal?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I've been told that rehearsal is
about to begin...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But the band members are still
shut away in their rooms...

And Lulu's just hanging around by
that lone island out back.
What's going on?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Is Lulu all right? She was just
staring out at the lone island in
back...She looks kinda strange.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Welcome.
What are you looking for?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We didn't have what you wanted?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Welcome.
Did you come to buy something,
little guy?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Didn't the big guy's shop have
what you were looking for?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Welcome.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you find something?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah! Mikau.
Welcome!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You don't quite seem like yourself
today, Mikau.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Gold-colored fish know this area
very well.

I was thinking of getting one to
guide me to Pinnacle Rock...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If the water wasn't so murky,
I wouldn't have to rely on the
guidance from a gold-colored fish.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I heard that the pirates were
attacked by sea snakes near the
creatures' lair.

It seems they dropped something
precious there. Don't you wonder
what it was, Mikau?

But we'd have to get through that
murky water to look for it...

Where are all the gold-colored
fish when we need them?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yo, Mikau!
The seawater has gradually
returned to normal.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But that weird, murky water hasn't
dissipated completely...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Before long, the fish will come
back, too!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you taking a relaxing sea
bath? Isn't the water here too
warm for it to feel good?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Plus, with all this murky water
around, you'd better be careful!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Can't you go for a nice swim now
that the water temperature has
gone down?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How is it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah! Mikau!
What are you doing in a place like
this?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is the ominous Pirates'
Fortress. I don't think you should
get too close.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Uh...But I'm OK...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, actually...

The pirates in this fortress are
all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Heh, heh...So, I thought maybe
I should check 'em out.

What??
Don't look at me like that...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Pirates' Fortress usually is
closed off by an iron gate, so you
can't get in from here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And even if you did get in, it's
not like the pirates would welcome
you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yo, Mikau!
Did you do something to the
pirates?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The pirates were just looking for
a Zora dressed in green clothing.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Isn't that you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It sounded like the pirates had
some unfinished business to settle
with you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you do something?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Is this your first time at the
ocean? This is the ominous
Pirates' Fortress.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you hang around too long, the
pirates will see you and get you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you came here to go swimming,
you should go somewhere else.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mikau! What are you doing?
Everyone's already up on stage.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Indigo-Go's will start
rehearsing soon.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mikau! Man, you're guitar playing
is the best!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How'd you like The Indigo-Go's?
Aren't they the best?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How do you feel, Mikau? We can't
wait to hear you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm so excited...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yeah! Mikau, isn't Lulu's singing
the greatest?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey! Did you hear that? This
guarantees the concert in town
is gonna be a huge success.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Late, Mikau?
Hurry up and get on stage.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Shhh!
Their rehearsal is about to start.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mikau!
That new song has a nice feel to
it. I really like it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What d'ya think?
Doesn't the new song by The
Indigo-Go's sound great?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mikau!!!
Hurry...Make your guitar gently
weep for me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't watch the rehearsal from
here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ohh!
You rock! Your guitar playing
really is the best!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, aren't they amazing? The
concert in town...That's gonna be
even better.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mikau! I can't wait to hear the
new song!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, you are so lucky! I just
heard that they're gonna play a
new song in rehearsal.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's a great song!
But the feel was a little different
from Evan's usual songs.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you hear the new song?
I think it's gonna go over well in
town, too.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey! Hey, Mikau!
Don't hang around here.
Hurry up and start the rehearsal!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I think The Indigo-Go's will start
rehearsing soon. What's that
Mikau been doing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's uncool, Mikau. Don't be late
to rehearsals. But it was a good
performance.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How'd you like it?
Can't wait for the concert, can
you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You finally came, Mikau. The other
members are standing by!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The moon's been kinda spooky
around here lately. Have you
noticed it? I wonder if I'm the
only one who thinks so.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That had a good feel to it. Now,
if the concert goes like that...

But of course it'll go that well.
Sorry. Don't mind me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That was a perfect performance
by The Indigo-Go's, wasn't it? But
I have a bad feeling about
something...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Leeeeave it!
Leeeeave it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

If you don't have it, I have no
need for you! Awayyy!

All the graves here belong to the

____________________________________
Did you see the huge skeleton at
the back of this graveyard?

My father once said that was all
that was left of the former Royal
Soldier who once guarded this
graveyard.
Even though he is dead, his
remains still block the way. In a
sense, he is still guarding the
Royal Family's treasure.
He must have been a fine soldier,
indeed.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you want see the dancing
bones?

If you do, then just wait here
until night comes.

I don't want to see something evil
like that, though...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't bother me!

Soon, a whole lot of frightful
ghosts will appear.

You should go home, too...
Before you get attacked!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

There are a lot of bats out today.
I don't like bats.

I wish they'd go away.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Aaaieeee!!!
Th-they're out!

Go away!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You? Wh-who are you? I can't see
'cause it's too bright...You're not a
ghost...are you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...A fairy?

Oh, it was the fairy's light. In
that case, it's just perfect.

I came looking for the Royal
Family's legendary treasure, but
my torch has gone out.

I'm sorry, but could you walk 
in front of me and light the way?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Please?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm not going to give up. I'll keep
asking you until you say yes.

That's how I courted my current
wife, you know.

So...Will you lead me through the
dark?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You will?
In that case, I'll use your light as
I walk.

Just lead me to the place where
you think the treasure chest is
buried.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'll even split the treasure with
you...I'm counting on you now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Where were you?
You suddenly vanished, so I got
worried. Your light is all I have to
go on.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey! Where'd you go?
I wish you'd walk a little slower.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh!
There's something strange about
this spot.

You want me to dig here?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...In that case, take me to another
spot.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Nothing's turning up.
Take me to another spot.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Something strange is here, but
it isn't any treasure. Show me
another spot.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Waah!!!
It's the leader of the ghosts!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The soul of a brave soldier from
Ikana rests here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Was it you who chased those bats
away?

That's a big help... 
It isn't much, but here's
30 Rupees for your trouble.
Take it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I...I ain't seen nothing and I
d-don't know nothing...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, that's a nice sword you
have...Heh, heh...

You know...Lately, frightening
ghosts have been appearing in
swarms in Ikana Village across the
river.
It seems they're the ghosts of
Ikana's Royal Family or something.

There's no one living there
anymore, so I moved nearby.
Heh, heh...

Now there's only a curious parent
and child living there while they
research the ghosts...Did I mention
that is one niiiiice sword?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Can I see it for a second?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, fine!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh?!? Really?
I don't want to trouble you, but...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wha? S-s-some red thing?!?
What is it? It s-s-seems hostile!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wha? S-s-some red thing?!?
What is it? It seems h-hostile!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yeah, the parent and child in
Ikana Village succeeded in driving
off the spirits with some giant
music box.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But I can't afford something that
ridiculously huge...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But that's just me...Heh, heh.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Of course, they need the river's
current to power the music box.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The river's all dried up, so there's
no value in stealing the music box
or ransacking the place...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Uh...Just rambling...Heh, heh.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I found him, green hat boy...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He's using this place as his safe
house for keeping his stolen
goods. Apparently, his name is
Sakon.
He came to the shop last night,
and I followed him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
His storage for the things he's
stolen is on the other side of this
rock door.
 
Only Sakon can open it. The only
way in is to wait for Sakon to
arrive.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'll wait...I've made a promise to
Anju. He will show up.

He's trying to pull it out of our
reach and make his escape...
We've got to hurry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's no good. This isn't the
switch...

Go check that room. There should
be some sort of mechanism.
Please! There's no time!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I don't like him...
But is there a choice?
Should we help him?

Not moving ahead in the face
of danger when you know it's for
the better is just like Tael.
...That's it...Let's go!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Yesss! My security system is

...We're locked in.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm sorry you got caught up in
all this. If you can get out, then
do it.

Anju is already fleeing to Cremia's
ranch.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You did great.
She'll...understand.
C'mon, let's go.
Play your ocarina and get us
outside. Let him be alone.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I got the Sun's Mask back!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There's still time!
I must get back to town!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh? Not yet?
I don't stand out at all?

...That's weird.
But I'm trying so hard...
Oh, well.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh?
Don't tell me...That's...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm shocked. You're the first
person who's ever spoken to me.

I've been here for many years,
waving my arms around and asking
for help, but everyone ignores me
and passes me by.
It's 'cause I'm about as impressive
as a stone, right?...I'm used to it,
though.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Umm...I have a request...Can you
give me some medicine that would
make even an unnoticable stone
like me feel better?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...After all, I'm a stone, so like a
stone, I won't move. I'll just wait
right here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah, that...Is that it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...I feel better, I think.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thanks...
Oh...here...
In gratitude...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now...Let me practice standing
out...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I am no longer part of the
living...My sadness to the moon...
I haven't left my dance to the
world...I am filled with regret.
(Translation)             
I am disappointed, oh moon.
I have died!

Oh, I planned to bring the world
together and stir it into a giant
melting pot with my dance!

If only I had taught my new dance
to someone...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Spread my dance across the world...
Train its followers...

(Translation)            
I have taught it to you, now make
it into a popular dance craze!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I am counting on you.

(Translation)            
I am counting on you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you the one who freed my
soul?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I served the Ikana Royal family.
I am the composer called Flat.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The songs connected to the Royal
Family that remain here were all
composed by my brother and I.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh...Sharp,
my dear brother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He sold his soul to the devil and
was the one who locked me in
here...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You who do not fear the dead,
learn well the song that is
inscribed behind me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And if you ever meet my brother,
I'd like you to inform him...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The thousand years of raindrops
summoned by my song are my
tears.

The thunder that strikes the earth
is my anger!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...I have made my request.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The thousand years of raindrops
summoned by my song are my
tears.

The thunder that strikes the earth
is my anger!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Here is written the song that
shall cleanse his cursed, black
soul.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What business have you in Ikana
Kingdom, land where only the dead
roam?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is no place for one as full of
life as you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Or do you say that you wish to
join the dead?

That is fine...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If that is the case, then sleep
gently to the melody of darkness
that the great composer, Sharp,
shall play...
and join the ranks of the dead.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I understand your desire...

You don't give up. I see you really
do wish to join the ranks of the
dead.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmm?
Somehow, my heart is eased. This
melody has a serenity to it...
And yet...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
To one of the dead and darkness,
like myself, a song like that no
longer holds meaning for me.

You shall end your futile
resistance and quickly join the
ranks of the dead.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
W-What is this?
...This song?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...N-No, it can't be. 
This song...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Flat, my dear brother.

Forgive your foolish brother who
dreamt of the revival of the Royal
Family...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Ye who do not fear the dead...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
With my brother's song, you have
broken the curse that was placed
upon me. It is all thanks to you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We dead should not be lingering
here in this land.

It was all a trick of the masked
one who had upset things.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you truly do not fear the
dead...

I wish for you to go to the
temple in this land and sever the
root of the evil curse that
torments us.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
To do that...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I, the only one who knows the
way into the temple, shall direct
you to the King.

The King is in the ruins of Ikana
Castle, awaiting the coming of the
one who will break the curse.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...I have made my final request.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Eee-hee-hee...
Ikana Kingdom was founded on
this land, stained with a history
of darkness, drenched in blood...
Even now it is a place where
troubled, regretful spirits gather.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you are seeking the one who is
stronger than you are, you may
find strength here...

from a group of spirits plagued by
lingering regrets.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you have faith in your skills
and might...

then try saving these wandering
spirits. 
Yee-hee-hee...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It is impossible in your current
state, but once you have eased
your weariness and have gained
faith in your skills...
You must try saving these
wandering spirits.
Yee-hee-hee...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But the earthly price you must
pay is 30 Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Will you still do it?
 
I'll do it
I won't do it
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is the kind of world we are
in, so this is the kind of business
that we must do. Yee-hee-hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, but you haven't enough
Rupees. Well, that is too bad.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You are a boy of much vigor.

Defeat the ladies within the time
limit and rest their souls in peace.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But if your life energy drops
below three hearts, I will stop
the match.

Mercy is the least I can offer.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you prepared?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Gripped by fear?
Yee-hee-hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It seems their souls have been
healed.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I give to you the earthly
possession which the ladies kept.
Take it, Link.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That is your name, correct? I can
read people's hearts...

I knew you would be coming here...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now, my own soul has been
healed, too. 
With that...
Yee-hee-hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Regardless of what mystical
powers you possess, you may not
fight any longer.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whatever mystical powers you
possess will not help you...

If it takes you that long, you
cannot ease their souls...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Try again with that much energy?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Gripped by fear?
Yee-hee-hee.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You cannot heal all souls with
that song.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The earthly cost to you will be
30 Rupees!

I'd like to be able to take that
much...
But I shall take 10 Rupees...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yee-hee-hee.
That's a nice mask you're wearing.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That is the mask of those who
roam this world with the most
lingering regrets!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Use it to ask them their regrets...

Perhaps you may be able to save
the souls that wander beyond
here.
Yee-hee-hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That is the mask of the leader of
the ninjas who once spied on the
hilltop castle with the
blood-stained history.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
With that, you may be able to call
out their spirits that even now
are still wandering.

Perhaps you may be able to save
the souls that wander beyond
here...
Yee-hee-hee.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yee-hee-hee.
You are wearing an interesting
mask.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That is the mask of the captain
of the soldiers who once served
to protect the castle on the
hilltop.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now it is the gathering place
for the spirits of those with
lingering regrets.

Until now they wander, seeking
one who can save them.

You cannot save them with that
mask...Have you no other? It is
unfortunate, but I cannot let you
pass. Yee-hee-hee.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yee-hee-hee.
Do you have your own horse?

And if you are not wearing the
mask that houses the wandering
spirits, which the black-hearted
one near the ranch has...
I will not let you pass.
Yee-hee-hee.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yee-hee-hee.
What are you doing in a place like
this?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ikana Hill beyond here is the place
where spirits with troubles and
lingering regrets wander.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Even now, the spirits wander
in search of one who can save
them.

It is unfortunate, but it is no
place for one such as you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But if you must enter, then you
must obtain the mask containing
wandering spirits that can be
found near the ranch.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Without that mask, you cannot
save their souls...

Until then, I will not let you pass
by here.
Yee-hee-hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yee-hee-hee!
Do you have your own horse?

And if you are not wearing the
mask containing wandering spirits
which the black-hearted one near 
the ranch has...
I will not let you pass.
Yee-hee-hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yee-hee-hee.

It seems, somehow, you have
managed to send the Ikana's
wandering spirits into peace...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But outside of Ikana...
There are still swarms of
wandering spirits with lingering
regrets...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The ones in this room want to
meet you again and have been
waiting here for quite a while.

Go see them if you feel like it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm sure they'll welcome you.
Yee-hee-hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yee-hee-hee.
You really are an amazing person,
Link.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It seems you've somehow managed
to heal their souls...

Maybe I shall vanish soon myself.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, then...
Yee-hee-hee-hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yee,-hee-hee!

If you want to meet the ones in
this room, then extend your life
energy more.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, insolent one who has brought
the unthinkable into a land as
dark as Ikana...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
My servants have fallen
namelessly before the light that
guides you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
However...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You shall see with your own
eyes...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're blocking me!
Get out of the way!
I can still get him!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
B-blocking you?!

The reason he beat us is because
you were so feeble! Don't blame
this on me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?!
Just try saying that again to
my bony face!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Feeble!
Feeble! Feeble! Feeble! Feeble!
Feeble! Feeble! Feeble! Feeble!
Feeble! Feeble! Feeble! Feeble!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Shut up, already!

Grrrr!!!
Don't look at me--I was once
called the best swordsman in all
of Ikana...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The greatest swordsman in all of
Ikana?
You?
Feeeeeeeeble.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Draw your weapon!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm telling you to draw your
sword!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
......

How?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Rrrrrr-Ah!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Will you stop?!!?
What fools!

Haven't you begun to understand?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The kingdom being ruined and us
left in this state...

Isn't it petty, little battles like
this that have caused it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Believing in your friends and
embracing that belief by forgiving
failure...

These feelings have vanished from
our hearts.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It all happened after somebody
thrust open the doors of that
Stone Tower.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You who bring light into darkness,
I am the King of Ikana Kingdom,
Igos du Ikana.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The spellbinding that had been
cast upon us was broken by that
light which you carry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
To return true light to this land,
you must seal the doors of Stone
Tower where the winds of
darkness blow through.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But Stone Tower is an
impenetrable stronghold. Hundreds
of soldiers from my kingdom would
not even be able to topple it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It is far too reckless for one to
take on such a challenge.

...And so...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I grant to you a soldier who has
no heart. One who will not falter
in the darkness.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This soldier who has no heart is
your twin image. A shell of
yourself that you will shed when 
your song commands it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
On my kingdom...shine the light
of justice...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The darkness in which my
servants live is, after all, fleeting.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
just what kind of thing true
darkness really is.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wait!
It is my loss!
Sheathe your weapon...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I commanded the Ikana Army of
Ikana Kingdom atop the hill. I am
called Skull Keeta.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Since being shamed by loss in a
battle within my kingdom...

I have waited here for one to
come and awaken my soul.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Young swordsman who has
awakened and deftly defeated
me...

I shall rely on your power to
fulfill my request.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I ask you to take my soul, which
rests in the fiercely burning
flame...

And convey my words to my men,
who, even in death, remain loyal
to me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Tell them the war has ended...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Then I shall be able to drift
quietly into sleep...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Captain, sir!

May I take leave, sir?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yes, sir!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ohhh! Keeta!
Is it not Captain Keeta?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...............But you're so...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I was nearly fooled by what you
have done...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you could not even catch me,
then that must be all the strength
you have.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Stop it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Who are you?
What are you doing just walking
into people's houses like this?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You again? 
Didn't I tell you to leave us
alone?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't!
It's me! It's Pamela!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Get out!
Forget everything you've seen here
and get out!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Father?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Pamela!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Father!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What have I been doing this whole
time?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You...haven't been doing
anything...

You had a bad dream.
You were just having a little
nightmare.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Pamela.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Um...What you did for my father...
Thank you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But...
You helping us...It's a secret from
my father.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whenever anything strange
happens, my father immediately
starts talking about doing
research...
and he does all kinds of crazy
things, so...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Once he calms down a bit, I think
I'll try convincing him to quit
researching in this dangerous
place and to go back to town.

So...
If my father sees you again...
...I'm sorry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Your strange power...
If father sees that, he'll surely
want to research it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's why...
I don't really want...
you to meet my father...

I'm sorry to say such a thing...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Who are you?
Don't just walk into people's
houses!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh!
Isn't this a fairy?

Is this yours, young man?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I am the famed academic who
researches fairies, ghosts and
similar so-called supernatural
phenomena.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
By the way, the song, Farewell to
Gibdos, which the music box is
now playing, drives away Gibdos.

I discovered it after many years
of researching Gibdos.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
In regards to ghosts, there isn't
another academic who can match
my knowledge, so ask me anything
you like.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...It's been some time since I've a
seen a fairy this lively.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Say, young man!
Would you permit me to do
research on this fairy?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! Hmmmm!
My Ghost Radar is reacting
fiercely.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But...
This is minutely different from its
usual response.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is a verrrry intriguing
response!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmmm...You seem to be both
similar to a ghost and different
from one at the same time...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is verrry intriguing.

Could you remain here a while and
permit me to research you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you curious about that
picture?

That is a mummified man. Its
scientific name is Gibdo.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
A tale in Ikana tells of a treasure
that rests at the bottom of the
well on the hilltop.

It seems the spirits of those who
became Gibdos upon entering the
well in search of that treasure
still linger inside
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's been said going down there is
a petrifying experience. So even
the mummy hunter may become
mummified!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I even tried to go into that well
once myself...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Strangely enough, though, I don't
remember anything that happened
there.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, you never know what might
happen, so it's simply best not to
approach it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you curious about that
picture?

That is the ghost of a ninja. Its
scientific name is Garo Robe.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
They are merely shells that are
empty on the inside. They're the
shells of spies from an enemy
nation sent to investigate Ikana.
They have been unable to forget
their living days. Even now their
spirits--emptiness cloaked in
darkness--continue to spy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
According to rumor, those Garos
frequently appear near the ranch
on the far side of town.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Although they are said to be
shells, Garos are still ninja and
they will not show themselves in
front of people.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yet there are many sightings near
the ranch...
That's strange.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! That mask is certainly a
Gibdo!

Young man!
Where did you get that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmmmm...The more I look at it, the
more this mask looks like a real
Gibdo to me.

With this mask, you probably could
convey your feelings to Gibdos.

Perhaps you could even investigate
the Gibdo life-form itself!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Say, young man!
Would you permit me to do
research on that mask?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Aieeyeaaah! Get out!
...It's already too much!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Thanks for stopping!
You're not from here, are you?

I sell Magic Beans to Deku
Scrubs, but I'd really like to leave
my hometown.

I'm hoping to find some success in
a livelier place!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But to open a business in another
place...
You need to go through the 
proper channels first.
Do you know what I mean?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sorry...but I must get back to
business.

You didn't understand my problem.
Oh, well. Don't pay it any heed.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! That's a Town Land Title
Deed! I wish you'd let me have
that.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'll give you this land in return!
Deal?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm going off to town right now!
I'll leave the rest up to you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thanks for stopping by!
I'm doing business with a focus on
a Deku Scrub clientele.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Actually, I want to do business at
the palace, but there's this big
octopus...and...

Nothing really can be done about
it, so I set up shop here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you know what magic beans
are, sir?
I'll sell you one for 10 Rupees.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you need any?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah, well, that's too bad.
If you ever want any, look me up.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, you don't know how to use
magic beans? Then, I guess I can't
sell you any...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You don't have enough Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You can't hold any more magic
beans!

Thanks again!

Thanks for stopping by!

Oh! You're the one who gave me
the land deed.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thanks to you, I've been able to
do business in the place I've
always dreamed of.

But there aren't many places to
plant beans around here...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thanks for stopping by!

I just opened for business! I hope
you'll do business with me!

Who'd have thought I'd meet a
fellow Deku in a place like this?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I sell bomb bags, but I'm focusing
my marketing efforts on Gorons.

What I'd really like to do is go
back home and do business where
I'm surrounded by trees and grass.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But I can't open a business back
home without following the proper
procedures...
Do you know what I mean?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So sorry.
You're not the one I should be
talking to. Pay no attention to me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's the deed needed to do
business in town.

I don't like places that busy...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah! That's a Swamp Title Deed!
I wish you would give that to me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'll give you this land in exchange!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I'm going right back to the
swamp!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Thanks for stopping by!
I'm doing business with a focus on
a Goron clientele!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm sorry, but I can't do business
with you if you're not a Goron.

It's a regulation of the Business

It can't be helped.

I'm doing business with a focus on

Right now, I've got a special

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I'll give you my Biggest Bomb Bag,

In return, you'll give me your Big

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?
But you already have the Biggest
Bomb Bag!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you don't have a Big Bomb Bag,
I have to sell it for 1000 Rupees.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Too bad.
You don't have enough Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh, too bad.
Come again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I'm selling Green Potions, but I'm
focusing my marketing efforts on
Zoras.

Actually, I'd like to do business
someplace where it's cooler and
the air is clean.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's a...

...Oh, that's a Town Title Deed.
The air's not very good in cities.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

That's a...

...Oh, that's a Swamp Title Deed.
I'm not going back home, yet.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So sorry. I've been talking away.
I'm sure this heat is making it
hard to concentrate.

Oh, that's a Mountain Title Deed!
Thank you!

I'm off to the resort!
The mountains are calling me!

I am doing business with a focus
on Zoras!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Sorry, but if you're not a Zora,
I can't do business with you. It's a

There's nothing I can do...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Thanks for stopping by!
I'm doing business with a focus on

Is this your room?

I'm awfully sensitive to the sea
breeze, so I'm sorry, but I'd like
you to rent this room to me.

...But, my, this is a messy room!
Did something happen in here?
Well, I really can't do anything
about it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I'll sell you a Green Potion for
40 Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You get the potion only!
If you don't have an empty bottle,
I can't sell it to you.

the title deed!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Even if it's just out of pure

No

I'm here to sell Blue Potion.

Actually, I want to do business in
the sea breeze while listening to
the sound of the waves.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's a..!

...Oh, that's a Town Title Deed.

The town is too loud to hear the
sound of waves.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

That's a...

Big waves don't reach the swamp.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Sea breezes don't blow on tall

So sorry. I guess I've just been
talking about a dream of mine...
Don't mind me...

Oh! If that isn't an Ocean Title
Deed. Let me have that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Please. If I have that, my dreams

I'm not asking for it for free.
I'll give you this!

I'm doing business here in this
canyon.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You should give up going to the
far side of the canyon. That place
is cursed.

If you don't have something that
drives away demons, they'll catch
you.

Rumor has it, demons aren't afraid
unless they see something that
looks the same as themselves.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't you need any Blue Potion in
case you get cursed?
One drink is 100 Rupees.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You should give up going beyond
here. If you don't have something
that drives away demons, you'll be
cursed.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, really?
You'll be cursed!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Ah! What are you doing here?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

This is my secret storage unit.
It's a problem if you come in here
without permission!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Please! I'll sell you a Piece of
Heart if you just keep this place
a secret...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
150 Rupees for one!
 
I'll buy it
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Hmmm...No good?
In that case, you leave me no
choice...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What about one for 100 Rupees?
 
I'll buy it
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, fine!

I'll make a new storage unit
somewhere else!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's not enough Rupees!

Fine!
This place isn't safe, so I'll move
somewhere else!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's not that I don't believe you,
but just to be safe, I'm moving my 
storage!

You hurry up and get out, too!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah, you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yo! Hey, baby!
I'm a stylin' scarecrow wandering
in search of pleasant music.

Time will pass in the blink of an
eye if you dance with me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you like, baby, we can forget
the time and dance until night!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, baby!
That's a nice thing you got there!

Let me hear a song you wrote
on that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
No, no, daddy-o!
That song doesn't sing to my
heart, baby!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yow! Oh, yeah!
That's a nice tune, baby.
By the way...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I know of a mysterious song that
allows you to manipulate the flow
of time...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, yeah!
Now listen up!

If you play that mysterious song
backward, you can slow the flow
of time.

And if you play each note twice
in a row, you can move a half
day forward in time!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How's that? Pretty interesting,
isn't it?

But I like the song you played for
me better, baby!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you want to see me again, play
that song you wrote for me here
or somewhere else!

See ya, baby!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yowza! Oh, yeah!
We meet again, baby!
What great playing, as usual!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you like, baby, we can forget
the time and dance 'til dawn!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But outside it seems to have
gotten kind of...dangerous.
Yikes...I'm gettin' outta town!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Shall we dance?
 
No
Yes
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, sorry. That's too bad. In that
case, come back anytime if you do
decide you want to dance.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, yeah!
In that case, forget the time.
Let's dance!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, yeah!
How was it? It went by in an
instant, right?
I'm still full of energy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
By the way...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I know of a mysterious song that

Do you want to learn it?
 
No
Yes
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, sorry. That's too bad.
In that case, let me hear a song
written by you, baby!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, yeah!
Now listen up!

If you play that strange song
backward, you can slow the
flow of time.

And if you play each note twice

In that case, see you later!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Now listen up!

It seems that if you play that
mysterious song backward, you
can slow the passage of time.

And if you play each note twice
in a row, you can move a half day

something like that before...

What?! Don't you know about
the Dinofols? Use targeting
methods while defending. And 
watch out for its fiery breath!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't tell me you don't know about
the Fire Keese! Defeat it before
it swoops down on you.
I do not want to roast!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?! Don't you know about
the Keese? Use Z Targeting when
it gets close. Even if it flies off,
I'll follow it for you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You know about the Armos, right?
Shhhh! Don't touch it! Blow it up
before it wakes, please!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's an Eeno.
It's persistent!
...And it's susceptible to heat!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Isn't that a Dragonfly?
As long as you stay away from
its tail, it's no big danger.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Stick with using the basic
target methods while defending.
...He's a different rank than those
other two lackeys, though...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It said that it's a Garo...
Just concentrate on blocking and
dodging those sharp swords!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's the Garo Master...
You can't fight him like an
ordinary Garo. Just dodge those
swords...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's a Wart.
Once you've gotten rid of the
spheres that shield the main body,
you can attack the eye.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's Gomess. There'll be no end to
it if you can't get those bats
away from it. Does that shed any
light on the situation?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hurry! Chase after it. Even if it
means throwing your own body
into it, do it so it'll stop!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's a Blue Bubble!
Quick! Run! Don't let it curse
you! If it comes after you, defend
yourself to block it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Use Z Targeting methods while
defending...The "Unthinkable?"
What could that possibly be
in a place as dark as this?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Just keep defending and watch his
movements. I think I'm starting to
see his weak point!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?! Don't you know about the 
Skullwalltula?
...Just don't touch it, all right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hurry! Chase him until you get
your chance at him! But if you
get too close, you might regret
it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It's a Yellow Chuchu.
That's nothing to sweat about.
It usually has something in its

It's a Takkuri.
Run! This bird steals your items!
C'mon! What are you doing just
standing around?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?! You don't know about the
Red Bubble? If it comes at you,
get in the defensive position to
bounce it back...Got it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hiploops are hotheaded,
so they'll charge if you look it in
the eye. If it comes at you, 
assume the defensive position.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's a Hiploop. Quickly dodge it
if it charges at you. But can't you
first do something about that
mask it's wearing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't tell me you don't know about
the Shell Blade! It's impossible to
beat it if you aim for anything
but its ligament inside the shell.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you go near it now, you'll be
eaten! Aim at it from afar to
weaken it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What are you doing?!?
There's no time to lose! Dive
underwater and attack it!
Hurry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
ReDead...
If it catches you in its paralyzing
glare, you won't be able to move.
Shake it off if you get caught!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It's a Black Boe...
Just calm down and attack it!
Look, there are just a lot of them,

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's a Gibdo.
You won't be able to move if it
glares at you, so be careful!
Got it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Just its head and tail aren't
protected by its hard exoskeleton,
so aim carefully. If only you were
the same size as it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's a Wallmaster! Keep an eye
out for it by watching for its
shadow on the floor. Get it before
it goes back up to the ceiling.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You know the Floormaster, right?
If you don't do something about
its pieces before they can 
reunite...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Remember your battles!
When something resistant would
deflect your weapons, what was
its backside usually like?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Remember your battles!
When you fought things that ran
around, didn't you battle them
using your own body?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Think about battles and weapons!
When you had the chance before
an enemy was about to attack,
didn't you usually try shooting it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You know about the Iron
Knuckle, right? Stay away from
its ax attack, then look for a
chance to retaliate.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You know about the Like Like,
right? It eats whatever you're
carrying. You'd better defeat it if
you want your stuff back.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?! You don't know about the
Beamos? Don't let its beam
scare you. Just give it a good
blast!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Don't tell me you don't know about
the Freezard! Watch out for its
icy breath! I hate the c-c-cold!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It's a White Boe...
Just calm down and attack it!
Yeah, yeah, yeah...There are just
a lot of them, OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You know about the Octorok,
right? All you have to do is
deflect that rock it spits out.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?! You don't know about the
Poe? If you try to use Z
Targeting, it vanishes.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's a Gekko.
And it's pretty angry!
It's pretty weak, too. It really
shouldn't be making a fool of you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't you know about the Blue
Tektite? Use Z Targeting to follow
it as it bounces!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You know about the Leever, right?
It actually moves pretty fast.
That's not exactly good news,
is it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't tell me you don't know about
the Pea Hat! Just remember that
its root area is soft!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Pea Hat Larva...You don't know
about it? If it comes at you, get
in the defensive position to knock
it back!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's an Eyegore.
Simply attacking it is no good.
I say you should pay attention to
the subtle changes in its eye.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's a Wizrobe.
You'll get your chance right when
it starts to attack. Be on the
lookout for it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

So you don't know about the
Wolfos? Lure it in and watch its
movements. It doesn't like its tail
to be touched...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's one Mad Scrub!
Even though it's weak, it sure
likes to attack!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It's Meg, eldest of the ghost
sisters. When she multiplies,
look for the real one!!!
Is this it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It's Jo, second of the four ghost
sisters!. Aim when she appears.
Hurry! There's no time!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's Beth, third of the four ghost
sisters. Aim when she appears!
Hurry up! There are still more!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's Amy, youngest of the four
ghost sisters. Target her when
she appears! You got that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The pirate found you!
Use Z targeting and look for your
chance. You're caught if you don't
win.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't tell me you don't know about

to be sucked in, keep your
distance. Aim from afar!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You know about the Big Poe,
right? Knock it back to stop it,
then take your shot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Look, don't ask me about
everything, all right?

Once it bites you, it's not gonna

That's a Green Chuchu.
It's nothing to be afraid of...It

If you get close to him, you'll be
beaten! Do you understand me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

That's a Gekko.
It gets itself all worked up and
then it just runs around.
I hate it.

That's a Real Bombchu!
It runs at you with its pack of

If he starts dancing and you don't
run...Well, then I really can't help
you!

The wedding ceremony is soon.
It might be early, but I finished
my wedding mask. I wonder if Anju
has made hers?
She tends to do things at the
last minute, so probably not. There
is a gathering of the fellows at

I plan to show off my wedding
mask and talk about my
sweetheart as best I can.

We're going to take refuge at

What's this?
Green clothes...White fairy...
Sir, could you, by chance, be a
forest fairy?
Oh my!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

My name is Tingle!
I think I am the same as you, sir.
A forest fairy!

Alas, though I am already age 35,
no fairy has come to me yet...

My father tells me to grow up
and act my age, but why?

I tell you...Tingle is the very
reincarnation of a fairy!

Good! So then it's

Now then, I'll be your partner...

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

____________________________________
With that, please excuse me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

to make quite a number of people
happy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The masks you have are filled
with happiness.

This is truly a good happiness.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Well, both of us have gotten what
we were after...
So this is where you and I part
ways, isn't it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You know...it was kind of fun.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Well...it's almost time for the

The rest of us have a carnival to

I own the Happy Mask Shop.
I travel far and wide in search of
masks...

During my travels, a very
important mask was stolen from
me by an imp in the woods.

So here I am at a loss...
And now I've found you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now don't think me rude, but I
have been following you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...For I know of a way to return
you to your former self.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you can get back the precious
item that was stolen from you,
I will return you to normal.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
In exchange...

All I ask is that you also get
back my precious mask that the
imp stole from me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?
Is it not a simple task?

Why, to someone like you,
it should by no means be a
difficult task.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Except...

The one thing is...
I'm a very busy fellow...

And I must leave this place in
three days.

How grateful I would be if you
could bring it back to me before
my time here is up...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But yes...You'll be fine.
I see you are young and have
tremendous courage.

I'm sure you'll find it right away.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well then, I am counting on you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why, hello...
Did you find that little imp?

If you can get back the precious
item that was stolen from you,
I will return you to normal.

Surely, you should be able to find
him right away.

Time continues to pass even as
we speak. There are only
ç left.

Please...
Do not forget my precious mask.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How did you do?

You'll be fine. Surely, you should
be able to recover Majora's Mask.
I believe in you.

Ah, but time passes even as we
speak...
There are only ç left.

Ho, ho, ho...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Were you able to recover your
precious item from that imp?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! Oh! Ohhh!!!
You got it! You got it!
You got it! You got it!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Then listen to me. Please play this
song that I am about to perform,
and remember it well...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is a melody that heals evil
magic and troubled spirits, turning
them into masks.

I am sure it will be of assistance
to you in the future.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah, yes. I give you this mask in
commemoration of this day.

Fear not, for the magic has been
sealed inside the mask.

When you wear it, you will
transform into the shape you just
were. When you remove it, you
will return to normal.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now, I have fulfilled my promise
to you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So, please, give me that which you
promised me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't tell me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
My mask...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You did...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
get it back...Didn't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What have you done to me!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you leave my mask out there,
something terrible will happen!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The mask that was stolen from
me... 
It is called Majora's Mask.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It is an accursed item from
legend that is said to have been
used by an ancient tribe in its
hexing rituals.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It is said that an evil and wicked
power is bestowed upon the one
who wears that mask.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
According to legend...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
the troubles caused by Majora's
Mask were so great...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
the ancient ones, fearing such
catastrophe, sealed the mask in
shadow forever, preventing its
misuse.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But now, that tribe from the
legend has vanished, so no one
really knows the true nature of
the mask's power...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...But I feel it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I went to great lengths to get
that legendary mask.
When I finally had it...

I could sense the doom of a dark
omen brewing. It was that
unwelcome feeling that makes your
hair stand on end.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And now...
that imp has it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I am begging you!
You must get that mask back
quickly or something horrible will
happen!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Were you able to get Majora's
Mask back?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You still haven't done it!

I keep telling you that if you don't
get it back soon, terrible things
will happen!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Only ç remain.
But time is not eternal.
Please make the most of your
time.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Surely you should be able to do
something.

Believe in your strengths...
Believe...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You'll do fine. Surely you will be
able to recover Majora's Mask.

Only ç remain.
But time is not eternal.
Please make the most of your
time.
I believe in you.
I will be waiting here for you.
Ho, ho, ho.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, yes. You...
You have the spirit of the Goron
who could not be healed...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So then...
Have you recovered Majora's
Mask?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, that shape?
You have the spirit of the Zora
who could not be healed...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That mask...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why that's...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Unfortunately, that's not the mask
I am looking for.

That looks like an expensive mask.

____________________________________
That's Romani's Mask, isn't it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That is a nice mask.
It is a sentimental item that
exudes a lot of maturity.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You have done some good work...
You went to a great deal of
trouble, didn't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm begging you! I'm begging you!
You must do it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Really?
You'll do it for me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I was certain you would tell me
that.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You'll be fine! 
Surely, you can do it.

Believe in your strengths...Believe...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You've met with a terrible fate,
haven't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So, did you find that little imp?

If you can just get back the
precious item that was stolen
from you, I'll return you to normal.

Surely, you should be able to find
him right away.

Time continues to pass even as
we speak. There is no time to
lose.

Please do not forget my precious
mask...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What are you waiting for?

You'll be fine. Surely, you should

I believe in you.

Ah, but time passes even as we

Your time is almost up.

Ho, ho, ho...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You'll be fine. Surely
you should be able to

Yet there's no time left.

Please value your time.
I believe in you. I'll be

Ho, ho, ho.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Now no time remains...
And time is not eternal.

What are you doing to my

Skull Kid, do you still think you're
our friend after that?!!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Well, whatever.

Even if they were to come now,
they wouldn't be able to handle

Hee, hee.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Just look above you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Tael!
Get away from the Skull Kid!

You'll be hit!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...I've had enough.

You hit my brother over and over!
I'll never forgive you!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That won't do you any good.
Hee, hee.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Why are you just standing

You've gotta do something now!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Huh?
When did you get that

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

...Tael!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

That's it!
I won't let things go the way you

I'll never forget the days we

you again...

Until that day comes, please...
Take this...

Good...We made it in time.
The giants' call worked on the
Skull Kid.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, Skull Kid!
Do you realize what you've been
doing to everyone?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I figured it out!
So, c'mon...Apologize to everyone!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wait...Sis...Don't...
Don't be so hard on the Skull Kid.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Tael! Why are you protecting him!
Aren't you mad at him for hitting
you so much?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He was lonely...
...the Skull Kid.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He was trying to destroy
everything around him!
That is not the same as a lonely
child! We can't allow that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The power of the mask made him
do it. It was too much for the
Skull Kid to handle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's 'cause he doesn't know his
place! On top of having a weak
will and no strength of heart...
he's a fool!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Certainly,
he had far too many weaknesses
to use my power.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yeah! That's right! Admit your
stupidity!

...Huh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Waahhhhh! This isn't good!
Let's go back! Let's go back!
Hurry! The Song of Time!
The Song of Time!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Aw, no....
You've got to be kidding. Don't tell

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I won't do it!
You go by yourself!
I'm staying here with Tael.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'll go!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?!
What are you saying, Tael?
Is something wrong with you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I don't always want to be running
away!

If only I had been stronger, the
Skull Kid wouldn't have...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I understand. I'll go!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
After all this time, Tael, you've
gotten really stubborn...
Just like someone else I know...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You know, you guys are really
stupid...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It stopped.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I think we're getting used to this!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well...Now you should be awake...
Stand up!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wait...Sis...
The Skull Kid...Don't blame him!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yeah, yeah. I know...
The Skull Kid was lonely 'cause
nobody would be his friend.
Blah, blah, blah...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And the power of the mask made
him do it 'cause it was too much
for him to handle...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How?
...How did you know that, sis?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Get back, Tael!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't worry.
Just leave it to your sister!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well? You're going in, aren't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...We can't do anything down here.
Let's go!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I've been thinking this ever since
I joined you...

You never want to give up.
You always want to try.
I admire you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you ready?
All right, but if something bad
happens to you, don't blame me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wait...Listen...
It seems to be saying something...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Could that crying be its way of
teaching us some sort of melody?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't just stand there...
Get your instrument...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
"Call us."
...That's what it's saying.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
W-What exactly are all of you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
"Guardians."
Guardians?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So...You're protective gods?

That's why you're in the temples...
But...why are the protective
gods...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
No, wait! Are you listening to
me? Hey! 
 
Wait...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, listen. We want you to lend
us your power!

If you just leave things as they
are, something terrible will happen
to this world!

Surely, you're the only ones who
can stop it!

That's what Tael was trying to
tell us!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
"Help our friend."
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I get it.
We have to help the last one!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Then promise us this...
You'll cooperate with us...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, we've helped all of you.

That's all we can do.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
"Call us."
 
That's what they're saying.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Without being told, we understand.
So now you'll help us out in
exchange!

We'll call you from atop the
Clock Tower, so do something
about him, all right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What? Their voices sound sad...
You don't want to?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Forgive our friend?

What do you mean by forgive?
Huh? What friend?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

____________________________________
Say...
Where did you get that mask?

That's Romani's Mask. Only adult
customers can get that mask.

But "adults" isn't really the right
term. It's not based on age, but
on a person's way of thinking and
acting...
Hee, hee. Somewhere, there's
a person who thinks of you as an
adult.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Umm...
That...
Do you...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Ah...You.
Did some middle-aged woman put
you to work?

Kafei isn't here...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh my? The Couple's Mask?
Someone got married.

My friend is going to be married
soon, too...Soon...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That mask?
Oh, that's right. The town should
be having its carnival soon.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, Dotour...

If they pick on you, you come tell

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

!!!
The mayor's son?
No good runnin' off before the
ceremony!
...I wish I could get mad, but my
own sons ran off in a hurry
before the carnival...

What a shame! I could cry!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey! We have a no-mask policy...
Wha??

I didn't think I'd see nobody
wearin' a mask like that no more,
but here's one.

So Dotour's wife is makin' you
search for him with this, eh?

Doesn't look a thing like 'im,
really. Then again, I guess it does,
so...um...
Hey...uh...I want you to leave now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Lookee here!
Don't be in'erfer'in with my dear

Don' go findin' that Kafei!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I saw him somewhere...
It was somewhere around here...

Sorry, I'm busy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ohh, how many people are gonna
ask me that? That lady is so
persistent.

Soooo, doesn't Kafei want to
break off his engagement to
Anju? Why not let him? That's
what he wants... 
Some people...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're the one my wife has hired?
So Kafei still hasn't...hmmm.

This is a secret, so don't tell
my wife.

Go ask at the Curiosity Shop, the
store in the west part of town
that only opens at night. That
guy is a bad influence on me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...I don't know where he is.
Even if I knew, it would be a
secret.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Kafei?

I can recall when he was in the
Bombers.

Don't see his face much anymore,
though...Well, what could he be
doing?

Try asking the children. The
Bombers know all about what goes
on in town.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I used to see him at the Laundry

When you sharpen your sword
skills, your mind is sharpened
naturally.

With the moon getting closer in
recent days, the number of the
weak and frightened has
increased.
But when you attain a master's
level of training as I have, there
is nothing to fear!

By learning at this training center,
you too can attain such a strong
mind and will.

Rumors are spreading which

Tonight, I shall cut the moon into

If you wish to be as powerful as I
am, then I shall teach you until
nighttime.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

First is the horizontal cut.
Simply press (B).
Now then...
Begin!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well done!
Do not forget what I have taught
you thus far and do not neglect
your daily practice!
Ah, yes, you can press ´ to
defend yourself with your shield.
Did you know that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wrong!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You must release (Z) and press
(A) to put away your sword!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do not Z-Target!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Fool!
What can I teach to one who has
no sword?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Hmmm. Impressive.
I must give you something.
Here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Your training is insufficient. You
must jump more!

Start over from the beginning.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whaa!
...You startled me.

Do not disrupt my training!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
In my mind, I am running for
exactly 10 seconds without looking
at a clock.

I was in the middle of mental
training!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You may make fun of me, but this
is quite difficult!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Will you try?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Then you are disrupting me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Press (A) to start.
Count 10 seconds, and the precise
moment you think you've hit 10
on the dot, press (A) again.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Your time was Ä.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh?!?
10 seconds?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That is amazing!
You have reflexes suitable for a
postman!

As thanks for showing me
something impressive, I give you
this.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I can't be like this!
I'll have to train more! More!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh! Almost!
That was a close one...

...Oh, nothing. Just talking to
myself.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
See! I told you it's difficult!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're past 10 seconds!

My, you're a slow one.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You look like you want to try
again...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'll let you try, but it will cost
2 Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Will you still try again?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Grr! You're disrupting my training!
Shoo, shoo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You don't have enough Rupees!
Hrrrrr...You're disrupting my
training!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whaa!
What...You again?!?

Don't keep disrupting my training!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So...

In my head, I run for exactly
10 seconds without looking at a
clock. I'm in the middle of 
mental training!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I can let you do it, but it will
cost 2 Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whaa! Those ears!!!
Oh, they're fake...
You startled me!

Don't disrupt my training!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Thank you.
You flee now.
That's an order!

____________________________________
Understood.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I don't need this anymore, so
here...I'll let you have it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ehhhh, I'm sorry...
Only Deku Scrubs can play here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Young Link, you will compete
against your best time.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How about it? Will the young one
play?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Young Link, you will compete
against your best time.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Try setting a new record again
today, young Link.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How about it? We're open only
until the carnival, which is the
day after tomorrow. So will the
young one play?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Young Link, you will compete
against your best time.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Good luck, young Link.
Now you can try for three
straight days of new records.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Even though today is actually the
eve of the carnival, it's quiet
above and no one's come down
here yet.
Will you play, young Link?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Even though today is actually the
eve of the carnival, no one has
come in. That's quite rare.

Now is your chance, young one.
Will you play?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
One game is 10 Rupees.
 
I'll play
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Come again.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You don't have enough Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
All right, then. Use this Deku
Flower and have fun.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If the time it takes you to get all
the Rupees is faster than the
current record, you get an
extravagant prize.
But if you fall down below just
once, it's over!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The best time for today's game is
ú.
Get all the Rupees faster than
that.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The best time for today's game is

Time's up.
You're done!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Too bad.
You can compete as many times
as you like, though.
Hee, hee.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Too bad.
You're done!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hee, hee.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

È
Amazing...It's a new record!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Take this.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Come again, young Link.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'll record this time.
So what's your name, young one?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmm, hmm...Link?
...That's a strange name for a
Deku Scrub.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you can, come by again
tomorrow.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
È
...Amazing. A new record...
And for three days straight?!?
Wow...We've been had.
Well, you're obviously a pro, and
pros can't play here.
Take this and don't come back.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Such a youthful face...
...But we were really dealing with
a fierce competitor!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ahh! It's Link!
Hide!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's time to change the setup!
Go home!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK, it's all over!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
È
Well, that's the way it goes.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK, burrow into the Deku Flower.
The game begins the moment you
jump out!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It looks like we have a visitor,
Honey.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I wonder if it's a customer,
Darling?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But from what I see, he doesn't
have a bow, Honey.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh...Then he can't play, can he,
Darling?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What should we do, Honey?
Surely this one doesn't have a
bow, so he can't play here...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh...Too bad. But, Darling, even if
he doesn't have a bow, he could
play if he had some sort of way
of shooting at things...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What shall we do, Honey?
I don't think this one can use a
bow...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But it looks like he can shoot
bubbles, so let's let him play,
Darling.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, will the little Deku Scrub play
again?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Target shooting runs until tonight,
so why don't we let him play,
Darling?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Would you like to play?
This time it's special...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Today is Target Shooting day, isn't
it Darling?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But from what I can see, he
doesn't seem to have a bow,
Honey.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh my...Then he can't play today,
can he, Darling?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, is this the one who got a
perfect score, Honey?
Do you want to play again?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Bombchu Gallery runs until
tonight, doesn't it, Darling?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

____________________________________
Today is Bombchu Gallery day,
isn't it, Darling?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But from what I can see, he
doesn't seem to have a Bomb Bag,
Honey.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh my...Then he can't play today,
can he, Darling?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you just get a perfect score?
Do you want to play again?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Basket Bomb runs until tonight,

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

What shall we do, Honey?
From what I can see, he doesn't
seem to be able to carry bombs.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh my...Then he can't play, can he,
Darling?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
One game is 10 Rupees.
 
I'll play
I won't play
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Honey, he says he isn't playing...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It looks like he doesn't have
enough Rupees. What shall we do,
Honey?

We have to share our happiness

That's annoying, so let's show off
even more for him, Darling.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The city is so busy it's hard to
find one's way-goro...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm terribly sorry. There are no
vacancies today...We're booked
solid with reservations.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I should have a reservation-goro.
The name is Link.
Don't you have it-goro?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mr. Link.
Ah! I do have your reservation.

Your room is our "Knife Chamber"
on the second floor. This is your
room key.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This place is falling apart. The
floor looks like you could pull it
up-goro...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I made a reservation...
The name is Link-goro!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mr. Link-goro?
I don't have a reservation under
that name.

There is one close to that, but...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?!?
Really-goro?
Well, it's nice weather, so I'll just
sleep outside-goro.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm terribly sorry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's a hard world to live in-goro...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah!
Uh, uh, uh, umm, umm...
What is this?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I have delivered this to you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah! Wait!

This letter, wh-where did you?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
From the postbox.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Th-that's not what I mean!
From the postbox where?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
From the postbox somewhere.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's not what I mean!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It will be lunchtime soon.
I must hurry up and cook.

...Grandmother is surely waiting.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I must hurry!
The guest arriving in the
afternoon will come.
Skip this, skip that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We used to be a cafeteria, but
after my father died, the room
rentals that were part of our
service became our main focus.
We're just a small inn with only
2 rooms, but people from all over
come here at this time of year...

See the performers practicing
outside? The second floor bunk
room guests are very spirited at
night with songs and dancing.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The customer coming this
afternoon will be staying next
door to them, so I hope it'll be all
right.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mmm...Mmm?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Please don't talk to me...
I'm about to drop this plate...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, Tortus.
I've already had lunch.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Grandmother...I am Anju!
Tortus was my dad...

And you haven't had lunch yet!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I've already had lunch.
Now be quick and take that away.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Not eating is bad for you.
Please eat...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Didn't I say that I already ate
lunch, Tortus?!?
Impossible child!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Then don't eat my food.
I give up...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whew!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
"Whew?"
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Er...
W-W-Whewwwould you like me to
read you a story?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh...That mask...

You, too...
You're also looking for Kafei.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're also looking for Kafei?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I have a request!
Kafei...I have a clue...that will help
you find him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Tonight at 11:30, please come to
our kitchen.
We'll talk then...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I will try to find him myself.
Asking someone else to do it...
I can't do that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I can't find him...
Kafei...

Where...
I wonder where he could have
gone...

And there's only a little time left
before...
our wedding...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah! ...Umm...Never mind!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I am sorry to trouble you late at
night. It's about him...Kafei.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I received a letter from...him.

Strange...Isn't it?
Getting a letter from a missing
person...

But there's absolutely no mistaking
it's from him!

It's clear...to me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Please!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Here is my letter.
Please put this in a postbox.

When this is delivered...When he
receives my letter... You should be
able to meet him!

Please tell him that Anju is
waiting for him.

And please, after you've seen
him...
Tell me how he looked.

I'm scared...I...I can't go.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Can I ask this of you?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thank you...very much.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Please mail it immediately in the
morning.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Uh, umm...Aren't you going to
take refuge?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Ah...Today's weather is
unfortunate, isn't it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I have decided to wait for him.
I've made my promise...

I'm fine with this.
I believe him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh...

Did you...see him?

...I'm sorry. It's too late, isn't it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh...

Did you...see him?

...I'm sorry.
It's probably too soon to ask...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh...

Did you meet him?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...It's from Kafei.
Th...Th...Thank you...
Very much!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Umm...What's that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Excuse me.
Have you seen a man in this
area?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He looks like this...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He...disappeared about one month
ago with his wedding ceremony
mask.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm...actually...afraid to meet him...

and to hear the reason why he
wanted to disappear...

It might be because of... me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There are only two days until the
carnival...
Should I wait?
Kafei...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah! That mask...
You're looking for him, too.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I came here thinking I would look
for him myself, but...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What a ramshackle inn. Is this
room first-class? You can hear
whoever's next door for cryin' out
loud!
Well, whatever...We're staying for
free, so we can't expect much.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
See, everything here is falling
apart...You can hear the voices
next door.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK, Anju, we're leaving in the
evening for the ranch.

Cremia will take us in. She is
your best friend, right?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I wonder if Kafei is really at
Cremia's place...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If Kafei is there, your mother will
give him a smack.

Besides, think about Cremia. She
needs strength from a partner and
business support from Madame
Aroma.
If Kafei really has run off with
Cremia, she'll get both. Please
don't be sad. How happy could 
you possibly be...
marrying a man who runs off
when he's about to be married?
It would make your life unhappy
...just like your mother's.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But in the letter it said he 
definitely would come back...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Come back to what??
Won't this town be crushed
beneath the moon the morning
after tomorrow?
Forget about that letter. For now,
just try to survive.
Everything else will follow...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yes...
Mother, Thank you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Everyone will be taking refuge
first thing in the morning. 
Everything was supposed to be all
so...spirited...It's sad.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We'll be going to Romani Ranch in
the evening to take refuge. I think
you should all hurry too.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Perhaps I was wrong...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But he said so...
The morning of the ceremony...
He'd come meet me in my room...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And I promised him I would wait...
But...already...it's too late, isn't it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Anju stayed in her room to wait
for Kafei...

It's foolish to believe a man
like that.

I too believed my husband would
return out of the blue...

Oh, Anju...
That child's naive sense of trust
may be my fault.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...I've been a little harsh on Anju.
...But, it's fine this way.

Right now, surviving is the
important thing.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm sorry.
We're going to be taking refuge in
the evening like the others.

You should run, too.
It seems it's going to fall
tomorrow morning.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm sorry.
Our rooms are filled.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, Tortus, you're late...

Tomorrow is another early day, so
good night. I'll read you a story
tomorrow.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, Tortus.
Did you finish helping father?

Then let mother read you a story.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now, which story would you like
to hear?

I'll pass
Carnival of Time  (2 hours)
Four Giants (Til morning)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Carnival of Time, is it?

The carnival is almost here, so it's
good for you to learn its meaning.
It's a little long, but I'll read it
with some enthusiasm. Ahem...
"The Carnival of Time."
Each year, the season of harmony
begins when the sun and moon
are in alignment.
Paying homage to the way that
both nature and time are
tirelessly in the process of 
progressing...
the Carnival of Time is when the
peoples of the four worlds
celebrate that harmony and
request fruitfulness for the year.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
For ages, people have worn masks
resembling the giants who are the
gods of the four worlds.

Now, it has become a custom for
each person to bring a handmade
mask to the Carnival of Time.

It is said that if a couple united
on the day of the festival and
dedicated a mask as a sign of
their union, it would bring luck.
The centerpiece of the carnival is
the clock tower, and on the eve
of all the festivities, the doors to
its roof are opened...
From atop the clock tower roof, a
ceremony to call the gods is held
and an ancient song is sung.

All of these festivities for the
Carnival of Time are held so that
we may ask the gods for a rich
harvest in the year to come!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You did a good job!
That's all for Tortus!

Now, when does the clock tower
roof open?
On the eve of the festival
I dunno
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well in that case, you try again
with mother.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You did a good job remembering.
That's the boy I'm proud of.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'll give you some candy as a
prize.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, are you awake?

I guess that story was a little
boring for Tortus, wasn't it?

Don't give up. Try again sometime.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Four Giants, is it?

This is quite long, but it is a good
story for you to hear, so I'll read
it with some extra gusto.
Ahem...
"The Four Giants."
This tale's from long ago when all
the people weren't separated into
four worlds like they are now.
In those times all the people lived
together, and the four giants lived
among them.

On the day of the festival that
celebrates the harvest, the giants
spoke to the people...

"We have chosen to guard the
people while we sleep..."

"100 steps north,
100 steps south,
100 steps east,
100 steps west."
"If you have need, call us in a
loud voice by declaring something
such as, 'The mountain blizzard
has trapped us.'"
"Or 'The ocean is about to
swallow us.' Your cries shall carry
to us..."
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now then...There was one who
was shocked and saddened by
all this.

A little imp.

The imp was a friend of the
giants since before they had
created the four worlds.

"Why must you leave?"
 
"Why do you not stay?"

The childhood friend felt
neglected, so he spread his anger
across the four worlds.
Repeatedly, he wronged all people.
Overwhelmed with misfortune, the
people sang the song of prayer to
the giants who lived in each of
the four compass directions.
The giants heard their cry and
responded with a roar.
"Oh, imp. Oh, imp. We are the
protectors of the people."
"You have caused the people pain.
Oh, imp, leave these four worlds!
Otherwise, we shall tear you
apart!"
The imp was frightened and
saddened.
 
He had lost his old friends.
The imp returned to the heavens,
and harmony was restored to the
four worlds.

And the people rejoiced and they
worshiped the giants of the four
worlds like gods. And they lived
happily...ever after...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Good job! Wasn't that fun,
Tortus?

What did the people do to call the
giants?
Sing a song
I dunno
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, really?
But you listened hard, so mother
is happy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'll give you some candy as your
prize.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's right, but you couldn't just
sing that song anywhere.

100 steps north,
100 steps south,
100 steps east,
100 steps west.
The spot at which those giants
parted is right in the middle of
this very town.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, are you awake?

I guess that story was a little
hard for Tortus.

But don't give up. Try again later.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, Tortus, are you ready?

It's been a long time since we've
had a picnic at Romani Ranch,
hasn't it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Isn't her bridal dress lovely?

We promised each other when we
were children that we'd marry on
the day of the Carnival of Time.

...But my promise...
I couldn't keep it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I...I have met you before.

What a familiar scent. Long, long
ago...Yes. We were still young.
We made a promise...
Didn't we?
The masks of the sun and the
moon...

We were to exchange them on the
day of the Carnival of Time...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Anju...
I'm sorry I was late.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Welcome home.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Tee-hee! They're lovers, but they
look just like a mother and child.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Let us exchange the promised
masks.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We have exchanged our oaths and
have become a couple.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You are our witnesses.
Please accept this mask.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Please take refuge.
We are fine here.

We shall greet the morning...
together.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmmm...Ah, well, that won't work...
No...That's too basic... 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We have to be ready without any
rehearsal this time...Every time...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We need a new step...Maybe with
more jumping...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Marilla likes this choreography,
but she doesn't get into it at all...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Judo's very good at it...
Maybe we should add some
spins...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If we do a poor job of extending
it, the audience will get bored...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Maybe I'll blame it on the troupe
leader and go back to the village...
But Judo wouldn't like it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We shouldn't change the song
now...Guru-Guru is scary when he
gets mad...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We're pretty prepared, but our
troupe leader seems to be acting
strange for some reason.
Well, we haven't even seen the
stage yet...It looks like we're going
straight to the big show without
any rehearsal.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Master!
Please come to our performance!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't bother us!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thank you for teaching us those
steps.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You are our master!

Master! You're so cool!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Doo-doo-doooo...
Don't speak to her right now. 

She hasn't finished her new dance
for the town's carnival
Doo-da-daa...

Even though the song is finished.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Doot-doo-dooo...
No time is left.
The dance isn't finished yet.

The song is now done,
but the dance is not.

I wish someone would teach them
one...A fancy step for these girls.
...Do-dee-do...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
La-la-la...
They said I was
much too loud
when I practiced in my room.
They got mad.
Sigh...Now I'm sad
I'll just stay here all night and
away from their pad.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
La-la-la...
They said I was

when I practiced in my room.
They got mad.
Sigh...Now I'm sad.
I'll just think about the past
to keep my mind off the bad.
Ah, yes, I'll do that...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Dear guest...Long ago, I was in an
animal troupe, with dogs and
donkeys and such.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why could a...? Why could a...?
Why could a man join?!?
That's 'cause a man is an animal,
too, my boy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
They were all great. But there
was one thing I didn't like
about it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why was the...? Why was the...?
Why was the dog the leader?!?
Was it 'cause something was
wrong with me, sir???
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, that dog was an amazing
leader! He always had a
stellar troupe no matter what
animals he had to work with...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's why I...That's why I...
That's why I stole it...
The dog's mask.
I stole it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I wanted it because it was the
leader's mask...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But I no longer need it...
I give it to my guest.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The leader was a good instructor.
His members matured quickly and
they became adults in an instant.

Funny. Funny.

The kidnapping?

Yep!
But then the kid woke up.
Get it? Kid napping?
Hooo...I got a million of 'em!

We're the twin jugglers from the
Gorman Troupe! We're practicing
for the big carnival! It happens
once in a blue moon!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Or in this year's case, once in

Did you meet the Rosa sisters,
our fellow performers from the

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

They're twins just like us! Can
you believe it? I think they're
practicing somewhere in West
Clock Town right now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

There are two sets of twins
traveling in Gorman's troupe of
entertainers! I mean, what are the
chances?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I'd say the chances are about one

Make that four in a million!

Would you like to join our

La-la-la...They said I was too loud

They got mad.
Sigh...Now I'm sad.
I'll just stay here all night and

And you are a child, so you must
go to bed.

Hello, Mr. Scrub.
How about this rain?

Do you scrubs feel sad on rainy
days, too?

....
But Deku Scrubs are supposed to
like rain. At least one of us has
reason to be happy...

Doo-doo-doooo...
Don't talk to her right now.

Although the dance for the
carnival is ready, the troupe leader
won't come to view it.

Though the song is ready, the
troupe leader won't come to
hear it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Doo-doo-doooo...
Though we're running out of time,
the troupe leader won't wake up.

In time's like this, it means the
leader has something he's hiding
from us.
Do-dee-da-da...
But the song is done...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We'll talk in the kitchen...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I have decided we will leave the
town tomorrow. We can't expect
anyone to attend our show.

Aren't you going to flee?

If you have nowhere else to go,
you should seek refuge at the
Gorman Track in the south. That
is my brothers' ranch.
My older brother...He's a nice guy.

Anju wrote about you in her
letter.

It seems you are looking for
Kafei.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Can you keep a secret?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Listen, when someone asks you
that, you say yes.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Anju trusted you.
I shall also trust you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I am Kafei.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Kafei we're looking for is an
adult. When I look at you, I just
see a child.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I was turned into this by a
strange imp wearing a mask...

But I'm not hiding because I look
this way.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
When I was turned into this,
I went to see the Great Fairy in
the shrine near the North Gate...

But on the way, my precious mask
--a wedding ceremony mask--was
stolen from me by some prancing
man with a grinning face!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well...You're just careless.
You're like my partner...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Before my wedding ceremony I was
quite happy. I was targeted
because of what I had been
turned into.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh my. I pity you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I know Anju is worried...but I can't
go out yet.
I made a promise to her that I
would bring the wedding mask and
greet her.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This pendant...
Give it to Anju.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Keep what we just talked about a
secret from everyone.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Things that get stolen in this

I'm waiting for that to happen.

Tonight's special bargain was just
stolen. It just came in seconds

I kid you not!
Actually, it's somethin' sold over
at the Bomb Shop, but a thief
sold it to me...

It's a Bomb Bag.
Check it out! Buy it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Tonight's bargain is
the All-Night Mask for use at
bedtime.

I forgot when this was made, but
it sure is a freaky mask...See?

When you put it on, you can try 
and try to fall asleep, but you
won't be able to.
Pretty creepy, huh?

I got a message from Kafei.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now Kafei...
I've known him since he was real
little...

But when he showed up looking all
young in that little brat body,
I didn't know what I was seeing! 
 
All it took was one glance at that
Keaton Mask he was carrying for
me to realize that I was looking
at my old friend.
I gave him that mask a long time
ago when he was just li'l Kafei.
Didn't know he kept it that well
for so long...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm not sure why, but...I want to
give this to you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
A customer came to my shop last
night...

Now Kafei sees him, and Kafei's
color just changes and he goes
runnin' after the guy.

The guy's a regular...
A greedy thief named Sakon.

I think he's from Ikana Village...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

'em all about you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

All right. Fine. I'll take it, but
you're guilty, too!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Don't be a fool!
A seller of stolen goods is just a

Look, I know nothing.

So sorry, so sorry.

Are you here buying fish? With
the ocean the way it is...

All we can do is put up with the
town's smelly fish, you know...

When you get back to Zora Hall,
give everyone my regards.
You sure do look like him,
though...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
With the ocean the way it is, the
professor at the lab has started
raising fish.

See, we don't catch fish anymore.
We eat them after raising them...
It's like cultivating vegetables.

I'm thankful and all, but he feeds
fish to his "crops." Feeding fish to
fish...That's a scary thought.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Zoras.

I'm out of business cards, so a

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Indigo-Go's is the popular
group that we Zora are so proud
of. They've put out a lot of songs.

One of their hits is
"Ballad of the Wind Fish."
You know that song, don't you?

Huh? You don't?
Really?
Even one that famous?
Hmmm...
You'd be able to hear it if the
show wasn't canceled. It's such
a shame.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Canceling the show isn't
something I want to do at all.

It was the first performance at
the carnival for The Indigo-Go's in
a while, so I'm sorry for the fans.

But with the diva the way she is
right now, a show would be...

Urr...Lately, only bad things have
been happening at Zora Hall...

Oh my, you...

You're the one I asked to search

The person I want you to locate

He disappeared about a month ago.
It's terrible! I'm so very worried...
I can't get food down my throat,

You haven't anything, though?
Oh, dear...

I am of the Gorman Troupe. I have
an appointment to meet with
Madame today...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, really?
Then that should be fine if you
just go in.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Madame Aroma, I am Gorman.
It has been some time...

Thank you for letting us perform
at this year's Carnival of Time.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, dear me...
Gorman! There's a problem!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Meaning?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The opening performance I've
asked you to do...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah, yes...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
They've canceled!
Just now!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
W-Wha-What's this?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Allow me to explain.

Oh, excuse me...I am to
work at this year's show
...Or that was the plan.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I am Toto, manager of the Zora
band, The Indigo-Go's.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He arrived this morning.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Actually, there's been an
unusual accident in Great Bay...

And due to this unusual accident,
Lulu, the diva in The Indigo-Go's,
has lost her voice.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The details are quite long, so I'll
spare you. At any rate...

I must cancel our performance at
this year's Carnival of Time.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
See!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Then this means...
the Gorman Troupe's...
jo-job is...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's off...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Bu-but that's!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's all, Gorman. There's always
next year. I'm busy with
other matters.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Bah! Bother! Bother!
I'm busy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm angry now!
Don't speak to me.

...They must be joking. Now what
am I to do?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
All must take refuge!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
On with the carnival!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Most of the townsfolk already
have taken shelter without waiting
for the Mayor's orders.

The only ones left are public
servants and committee members...

Mr. Mayor and Carnival Committee
Members, please order those who
remain to evacuate!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ahh...hmm...well...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You cowards! Do you actually
believe the moon will fall?

The confused townsfolk simply
caused a panic by believing this
ridiculous, groundless theory.

The soldiers couldn't prevent the
panic, but outside the town walls 
is where the danger is!

You want answers? The answer is
that the carnival should not be
canceled!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Isn't that right, Mr. Mayor?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you serious, Mutoh?!?

It seems that giant chunk of rock
above us hasn't caught your eye!

At this time every year, we are
overrun by tourists! So why is
the town empty?

Clearly, it's your job to ensure
the carnival's operation, but that's
if people are here for it!

Don't drag the merchants and
soldiers into this!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Mmm...Hmm...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If the soldiers wish to run, then
run, Viscen! We councilmen will
stick to tradition.

This carnival will be a success!
I've never heard of a defense unit
abandoning its town!

Madame Aroma would surely say
the same thing, wouldn't she,
Mayor Dotour?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Let's not bring my wife into this.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You take refuge, too.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Couple's Mask. What a nice
reminder...So, a young couple has
been married.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I wonder...Did my wife flee?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What!?!
What did you just say?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yes, yes, everyone. We are all
worried for our families. Why don't
we end this meeting?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But, Mr. Mayor!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This will do. Whether you're
stubborn and will stay and guard
your family, or if you'd prefer to
run far away and seek shelter...
That is for people to decide on
their own.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
........!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thank you for allowing me to put
an end to all that pointless
bickering.

Adults are all so stubborn...
It is shameful.

Here is a token of my gratitude.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, I may be an unreliable
Mayor, but at least my family can
depend on me. I want to protect
my wife.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...I tell you...It's hard to figure
which way things will go.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...I tell you...It's hard to figure
which way things will go.

See, because Mutoh said he would
call my wife...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The carnival is...on.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Captain Viscen!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...The Mayor's orders are absolute!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So the gate guards are still
standing by...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Standing by!
Cripes!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Welcome
Do you have some
business?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The room on the left is
the Mayor's room...

It sounds like they're having some
kind of meeting, I think.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The room on your right is the
drawing room and it's also Madame
Aroma's office. 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...My directions...
Do you want to hear them again?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The room on your left is the
Mayor's Office...

And the room on your right is the
drawing room and it's also Madame
Aroma's office.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The room on your left is
The Mayor's office...

It sounds like their...
whatchamacallit... meeting ended.
A lot of tough guys walked out.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The room on your right is
the drawing room and it's also
Madame Aroma's office.

Don't go in there without an
appointment. The lady will get mad
at you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are the fins damp lately?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh. That's the greeting used
among us Zora.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Where's your momma, sonny? Huh?
You came here by yourself? Well,
aren't you a big boy?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Once you get older, sonny, come
see The Indigo-Go's perform live at
Zora Hall.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh dear, are you a student of
Deku Elementary?
Where's your teacher?

You shouldn't be here. Field trips
go next door. Tell your teacher
that.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you find your teacher?
Your teacher's not here???
Well, then I don't know what to do
with you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Just what should I,
I mean the Gorman Troupe, do?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, Gorman, I wish it was only
your face that was annoying me
right now.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...So I may enter, miss?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ahh...I think so.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
....
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's that...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The bar opens at night, sir.

And it's members-only. We refuse
people who don't have proof of
membership.

Well, now I'm getting things ready,
so as long as you don't get in the
way of my cleaning, you can stay.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We're called a Milk Bar, and we
serve the milk of the night.

Our most popular, of course, is
Chateau Romani. It's a vintage
milk.

It comes from Romani Ranch, and
the current price is 200 Rupees!

...You're not surprised?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There is one more surprising thing
about this milk...

It depends on who you ask, but
there are those who consider this
milk as a source of Magic Power!
It takes just one gulp they say!
It's expensive, but thankfully, it's
the one we serve the most.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Last night, we got some fresh
milk in for the first time in quite
a while.

Finally, we can feel good about
our drinks' quality again.

But that moon...Our regular
customers have all fled. So there
really isn't any good news.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
To make things worse, we're short
on stock.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There is a road to the south of
town called Milk Road.
This could be someone's prank...
You see, the road is blocked by a
huge boulder.
I can't get any milk in from the
ranch now, so I can't please my
customers. It's terrible!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Are you looking for young Kafei,
too?

It seems Madame Aroma still
doesn't know where he is...
But he's not the type to just run
off!
He must have a reason for not
showing himself.

Just wait...When the time is right
and he's ready...he'll show himself.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The young one's mask, eh?
I think it's a waste to look for
him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What are you staring at?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sounds like your show has been
canceled. You don't really need to
be here anymore.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I came to drink!
I...I'm a customer!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well then, customer, the bar
opens at 10 o'clock at night.
Please wait 'til then. And besides
that...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This bar is for members only.
Those without proof of membership
will be refused entry.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, then I don't need milk!
I just want to sit and think for a
while... 

Just give me a place to do that...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Fine. Be my... guest.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ohhhh...What am I going to say to
the troupe members?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sir...It's the rules. Please wear
your Romani's Mask inside the bar.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Welcome...
 
Speak to shopkeeper
Have a drink
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What'll it be?

Regular Milk: 20 Rupees
Chateau: 200 Rupees
Nothing
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You don't have enough Rupees, sir.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Give me a call when you make up
your mind.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Members of this club bring their
own glasses.

We ask that you have an empty
bottle to drink out of when you
order.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There is a road to the south of
town called Milk Road.

Someone must've pulled a prank
out there, because the road is
blocked by a huge boulder.

I can't get any milk in from the
ranch, so I'm not sure if I should
recommend the Chateau Romani
to you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...As you can see, all of our
customers have taken refuge.

It may be my undoing, but I'm the
sort of fellow who'll stay at his
business through thick and thin.

And I continue standing here
at the counter hoping one of my
favorite customers will appear...

And I wasn't wrong.
See? You stopped in.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We've got some good milk in
tonight.

Would you like some Romani for
your final moon viewing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I remember when I was back at
the ranch. My brothers...
I wonder how they are...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey ...You!

Milk...

It's miiiilk...

Can you get tipsy from something
like milk?!? Hic!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...What? Hic!

...Don't look at me! Hic!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Anyway, I'm just the despised
second son!

I can't handle horses like my older
brother!

I can't take care of horses like
my younger brother!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I left the ranch, came to know
the world of show business...
Traveled around...
But for what?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...For nothing!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, I just had to enter the world
of entertainment, didn't I?
It's cold...Soooo cold...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh dear, are you all right with
not fleeing?

It looks like this is it for this
town, you know. You saw the
moon, didn't you? It's gotten so
huge.
All the townsfolk have fled. You
should flee, too. Far away...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh dear, you're the one searching
for Kafei.

How is it?
Have you found him?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Oh dear, is that so?
You haven't found him...

Well, that's enough.
Good work...
Now you flee, too...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And what does that have to do
with anything?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh dear...Priority mail?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This!!!
It's from Kafei! Correct?
Correct?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wonderful! You really are an
expert!

Yes, yes, I'm sorry.
My thanks.
Yes, yes, it is your job, after all.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm sorry.
At this point in time, I can give
you only something like this.

Actually I wanted to give this to
you sooner...
Really!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, are you going to play for us
again?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I wanted you, too, to hear Lulu's
voice on this stage.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We were scheduled to do a show,
but it got canceled.

This place has a reputation for
being a great live venue, so it's
a shame.

I'd like to do a sound check,
though. I just want to see what it
would have been like...
Hey, you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Could you help me with
a performance?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, that's too bad.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK! You play guitar, right?
Stand beneath the spotlight on
the right.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!
The guitar goes on the right,
the right!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK!
Play your guitar like this...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK! You play the pipes, right?
Go stand under the front-left
spotlight.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!
The pipes go under the front-left
spotlight!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK!
Now, play your pipes like this...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK! You play the ocarina, right?
Go stand under the center
spotlight.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!
The ocarina goes under the center
spotlight!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK!
Play your ocarina like this...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK! You play the drums, right?
Go stand under the rear-left
spotlight.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!
The drums go under the rear-left
spotlight!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK!
Play your drums like this...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK!
That feels good!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What feels good?!?
That wretched, senseless racket?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Bravo!!! That was the best!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Tha-That melody...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That melody...It brings back so
many memories!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's their old standby...
"Ballad of the Wind Fish."

That's the song that members of
the previous generation of The
Indigo-Go's made famous!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I entered show business because I
heard this song at the Carnival of
Time long ago...

By doing performances, I thought
maybe I'd get to meet the singers
of that song...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The one you heard singing must
have been the original Lulu,
mother of the current lead singer
who's also named Lulu.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So her daughter is singing now...

Is that so?
I'd like to hear that...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm sorry I booed you...
Please, take my mask.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You've done good work...
Now you flee, too...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah, yes, you are a member...
I'm sorry, but the bar opens at
10 o'clock at night.

I'm getting things ready now.
If you just want to talk, I'll let
you stay...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I don't think I need to explain this

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Listen, buddy...
This is a place adults come to.
Come back once you're an adult.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Sorry, buddy.
I'd like to serve you milk, but

You take care of things outside,
Grasshopper!

If you have a map, watch your
map carefully!

OK? Whatever happens, do not let
them get into the barn!

They'll come from behind the barn, 
too, so watch out.

Hello, Mr. Foreigner.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, who are you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm Romani.
I was given the same name as the
ranch.

What's your name?
 
Link
I won't say my name
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Link?
That's a nice name, but...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmm...
Well, all right then.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How about...
Grasshopper?
That's the name Romani gives you.

See, you're wearing green clothes,
and you patter about when you
walk, so Grasshopper it is!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Romani was practicing...
For tonight...Tonight...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
They are coming...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
They...
They come at night every year
when the carnival gets closer.

They come riding in a bright,
shining ball, and many of them
come down...to the barn...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
My older sister won't believe me...

But Romani must protect the
cows!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, Grasshopper, I'm recruiting
for an assistant right now!

You're a boy, won't you try?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh...I see...

My strategy begins tonight at
two. I'll be waiting by the barn...

I'll be waiting by the barn.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Great!
Now that's the spirit,
Grasshopper!

OK then, I'm going straight into
my strategy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
They'll appear all over the ranch...

They'll aim for that barn and
approach it slowly, so hit them
with arrows so they can't get in!

You got that? And you mustn't
leave the ranch!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Grasshopper!
Let's practice right away!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Will you help me, Grasshopper?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Want to practice again?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The operation begins tonight at
two. I'll be waiting in the barn.
Don't be late!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There are 10 ghost-shaped balloons
in the ranch, so hurry and burst
them all. If you take over
2 minutes, you're out.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The current record is
ù.

Are you ready?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK! Time's up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
When your arrow hits these, they
burst into nothing, but the real
ones will keep popping up!

If they get in the barn, we lose!

They run away at first light of
the sun, so we'll have to keep
fending them off until then!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you get that?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The operation starts tonight at
two. I'll be waiting in the barn.
Don't be late!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK! You're done!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
È?!?
Amazing! It's a new record!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
È!
That's great.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You two work perfectly together!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I'll teach Romani's horse-calling
song to you, Grasshopper.

Now you two keep getting along,
and go practice some more!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey, aren't you a little rusty?

Want to practice?
 
Yes
No

Hmmm...Confident, aren't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Want to try again?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

What is it for?

Good evening, Mr. Foreigner!

Romani is looking after things.
My sister went to town.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...Ah!

My sister told me to never let
strangers know that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm sorry!
Pretend you didn't hear that!
My sister will get mad at me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sorry!

My sister will get mad at me.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Is that a carnival mask?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, that's nice. Romani wishes she
could go to the Carnival of Time
just once! I've never been!

My sister always tells me that I'll
be an adult...someday!

That's fine for her! She gets to
go to town to make deliveries!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________

Romani knows...
My sister, Cremia, has someone in
town she likes...

But that person will get married
the day of the carnival. It's hard
for my sister...
Going into town...

About last night...
It's a secret from my sister.
I don't want to worry her!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Listen, Grasshopper!
Romani is looking after things!

Now that we chased them away,
things are safe. My sister doesn't
need to know at all!

Hey, Grasshopper, can I ask you
to help next yea...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
.....!
I know, Grasshopper!

Why don't you just live at the
ranch? I'll lend you Romani's bed.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
My sister will be happy, too!
It's a great plan! So...It's decided!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You're our bodyguard, Grasshopper,

Grasshopper.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Confident, aren't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

They...
They come at night...every year
when the carnival approaches...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
They come riding in a bright,
shining ball. A whole lot of them
come down...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

And then...
They come to the barn...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh my! Did you come from town?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't do that!
Lying to a lady...

You can get to this ranch only
from Clock Town...

Hmmm...
So you just didn't want me to
ask. Sorry for giving you such a
hard time.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

and frazzled, and I'm finding
broken bottles everywhere...
Who's doing it, I don't know...

With somethin' that big, it's sure

Hahhh...Oh, well.

You know what this place is?
This is the Gorman Brothers' horse
training center!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You got no business here if you
got no horse.
Now beat it! Scram!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I told you this is a horse training
center! It means nuthin' if you
got no horse! Got it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, sir.
Heh, heh...What brings you here?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We're the Gorman Brothers and
this is our horse training center...
Without a horse...you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now, now...Don't get angry.
All right, if you don't have a
horse, go ahead and take a look
around.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is just between you and me,
but if you need a horse, there are
a bunch next door at Romani
Ranch.
Some young girl's running it. I bet
she wouldn't notice if ya stole 
yourself one!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, you!
What are you doin' in a place like
this?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We're the Gorman Bothers and
this our horse training center!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Don't come to a place like this
when you can't even ride a horse!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Won'tcha buy some fresh milk?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is just between you and
me...

That milk they produce down
yonder at Romani Ranch is
watered down a bit. It's not worth
drinkin'.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We don't do that kinda thing here.
Ours is the real deal. It's always
fresh and full of vitamins.

It's true! I'll sell it cheap just for
you. How about it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
50 Rupees will do ya for one
drink!
I'll buy it
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, really?
Milk this good'll cost you double in
town. This is true!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You don't have enough Rupees...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm only sellin' the milk! Where
d'ya expect me to put it? You
need an empty bottle if you want
some!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Much obliged.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Buyin' milk?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We're different from Romani
Ranch. Our milk is fresh and full
of vitamins. This is true!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Is that pathetic thing your horse?

I would've guessed that little thing
was a mule fer sure, ain't that
right, little brother?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do ya think a horse that pathetic
would gallop if you pushed (+)
forward? Or would it run faster
if you pressed (A)?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This guy's funny!
Why don't you give us 10 Rupees
for the chance to race against
us?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you win, we'll give you somethin'
nice, kid.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What'll you do?
 
Race
Don't race
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Then don't come to a place like
this on your horse!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You gotta keep at least 10 Rupees
handy! Why would you carry
around a nice wallet like that
then?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's a simple race. Just go once
around the track. If you can beat
us to the finish line, you win.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hyuh, hyuh.
You ready?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hyuh, hyuh!
We win!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you like, we'll let you race us
again.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What'll you do?
 
Race
Don't race
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This guy's no fun!
That's why you don't succeed!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I can't believe we lost!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Big bro, I wonder if we can give
that to this guy?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We gotta give him something. Well,
he's a kid, so what could he do
with it? It should be fine...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
In exchange, you can't tell anyone
where you got this!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We gotta give ya something, 
so you got yourself some milk,
kid!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Urgh...I thought so...
No empty bottles!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, that's really too bad. And I
was really gonna give it to you,
too. It's true!
...Too bad! Too bad!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Easy there! Don't waste it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Race against us for 10 Rupees?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you win, we'll give you
somethin' nice kid.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now that's not your horse, is it
now, sir?

Well, that thing's just a colt...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you hang out 'round here, you'll
get eaten by that thar horse!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?
Did you come runnin' here from
town?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well it's been only that type of
folk coming 'round here lately.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sorry, but this is no place for
you to take shelter.

You say the moon's gonna fall
soon? Ha! That's silly talk!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is a horse training center!
It don't mean a thing if you don't
have a horse! Got it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah, sir, do you have some
business at the Gorman Brothers'
Ranch on such a terrible day?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey you! What you doing in a
place like this on a day like
today?!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We're the Gorman Brothers and
this is our horse training center.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you don't hurry up and get
outta here, you'll get eaten by
that there moon!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Seems some monstrous Garos
appeared at Romani Ranch
yesterday.

And I heard the wagon carrying
their milk was attacked.

I tell you, that's a dangerous
place...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Seems like we're the only ones
who have any milk left.
Hyuh, hyuh.

If you like, I'll sell you some.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
50 Rupees will do ya for one

I'll buy it
No thanks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh, really!
Milk this good'll cost you double in

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Heh, heh...Much obliged.

From here on out the milk
business will be ours!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We're the only place you'll be able
to get milk from!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Shall I sell you some?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Is that your horse?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I bet even that horse runs a little
if you press (+) forward. And it
probably runs faster if you press
(A) while riding it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
For 10 Rupees, you can have the
opportunity to race against us...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We're in a good mood today.
If you win, we'll give you
something good, kid.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Heh, heh...We win!!!
We're on fire!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you want, we'll race you again...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What'll you do?
 
Race
Don't Race
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Then we're busy. Now be off!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I can't believe we lost!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Big bro, I wonder if we can give
that to this guy?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We gotta give him something.
Besides, we don't need it anymore,
so what's the big deal?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
In exchange, we don't want you
telling anyone where you got this
from!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We gotta give him something. And
that something is...milk!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ugh...I thought so...You don't have
any empty bottles on you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, too bad. And I was really
gonna give you some milk if you
had an empty bottle to put it in...
It's true! Tooooo bad!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And they say the world is a hard
place. Look at you! I'd say you're
pretty lucky!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
For 10 Rupees, you can race us.
How about it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We're generous guys, so if you
win, we'll give you something really
good, kid. It's true!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, sir, shouldn't you take refuge
somewhere?

I mean, there's that rumor and all.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you hang around here, you'll get
eaten by a spooky Garo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ah, that mask...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's our middle brother's
big bro!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So, he's gone into the world of
entertainment...

That younger brother of mine is
really struggling...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Compare what he does to what we
do...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
No! No! Noooo!
And the things that we, the
Gorman Brothers, have done...

Grrrr...
We're the notorious Gorman
Brothers! We can't get all sappy
over stuff like this!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm sorry, but take that mask off.

I can't get anything done when
you gaze at me with that mask
on.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
.........
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Take that mask off.
I can't speak when you look at me
with that mask on your face.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
.........
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
...It's no use.
When you look at me with that
thing on...I can't talk to you like
that...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I hear some ghosts or something
appeared at Romani Ranch
yesterday, and now all their cows

That's one real dangerous ranch.

What do you want?

This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy
Racetrack, just like the sign says.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you want to try a dog race?
The minimum bet is 10 Rupees.

Will you still try?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Then first, go in and fetch the
doggy that you think will run the
fastest and bring it here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hurry up and bring me the doggy
that you think is fastest!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's why I told you in the
first place! You can't play if you
can't pay the minimum bet of
10 Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Is that doggy fine?
 
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, don't hesitate! Hurry up and
choose yourself a doggy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If the dog you brought me takes
1st place, you get triple your bet.
2nd place gets double.

If the dog you've chosen places
3rd through 5th, you'll break even
and get back however much you
bet.
If your dog does any worse than
that, you'll lose whatever you bet.

1st place!!!

You win triple the amount of your

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sweet hounds of happiness!
You took 2nd! That's amazing!

You win double the amount of
your bet! Î!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, almost...
Well, I'll give you back the amount
you put down.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That was a bad choice!

If you don't know how your pup is
feeling, you won't be able to know
how it'll do in competition.
Get with it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________

You've won over 150 Rupees, so I

All right. All right. Calm down...
